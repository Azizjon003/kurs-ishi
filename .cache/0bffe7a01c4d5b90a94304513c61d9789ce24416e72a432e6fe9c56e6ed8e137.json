It will enhance your knowledge and understanding of assessment practices. Whether you’re seeking definitions, explanations, or simply looking to expand your assessment vocabulary, this glossary has got you covered.\nExplore the sections below to delve into the world of assessment terminology and gain a solid foundation in understanding the key concepts and principles that underpin assessments in education.\n### 1\\. Achievement tests:\nAchievement tests are administered to determine how much a student has learned in relation to a specific course, textbook, or program of teaching. It is a [criterion-referenced test](https://www.myenglishpages.com/glossary-assessment-terms/#criterion-referenced-test) in the sense that it measures a test taker’s performance according to a particular standard or criterion that has been agreed upon and may determine the passing score.\nAs opposed to a [progress test](https://www.myenglishpages.com/glossary-assessment-terms/#progress-test), which is offered frequently throughout a program of instruction to measure language acquisition up to that point, an achievement test is normally administered at the end of a course.\nThe results are taken into consideration to make decisions about learners’ advancement or graduation, as well as to assess the success of a program, which may lead to curricular adjustments.\n### 2\\. Alternative assessment:\n**Alternative assessment** is also known as authentic or performance assessment. It’s a different approach to typical assessment, which is based solely on standardized tests and exams. In alternative assessments, students are required to complete tasks such as presentations, case studies, portfolios, simulations, and reports, among others. It is concerned with what students can accomplish with their knowledge rather than what they know.\n### 3\\. Assessment\nWhile [evaluation](https://www.myenglishpages.com/glossary-assessment-terms/#evaluation) is concerned with the collection of information to judge a curriculum, assessment is concerned with the student’s performance. It involves collecting and organizing data about the learners in order to make decisions and judgments about their learning. Generally, we assess a learner’s skills or performance, but we evaluate the effectiveness of a curriculum.\n### 4\\. Benchmark\nA **benchmark** is a detailed description of a specific level of performance expected of learners. Using benchmarks to assess learners’ achievement assists institutions and educational agencies to determine if the evaluated pupils meet current grade criteria.\nAs an illustration, students’ achievement is frequently compared to a benchmark that is appropriate for their age and grade. For example, students in grade 5 and grade 6 will have different levels of achievement, and their success will be measured against what is expected of students of their respective ages and grades. Similarly, candidates who are trying to enroll in a particular university, need to have a certain level of knowledge. They are required to meet the university benchmarks.\n### 5\\. Bloom’s taxonomy\n**Bloom’s Taxonomy** is a taxonomy developed by B. S. Bloomy to categorize the levels of reasoning skills that students use for learning. This taxonomy consists of six levels (i.e., **_knowledge, comprehension, application, analysis, synthesis, and evaluation_**) ranging from the ability to reproduce facts to the higher-order ability of thinking.\nInstructional strategies, learning objectives, and evaluations can all be developed using Bloom’s taxonomy. Assessment based on lower-order categories in Bloom’s Taxonomy may require students to reproduce facts. However, to assess higher-order categories students are invited to do tasks such as case studies, presentations, data comparisons, and the creation of a product.\n### 6\\. Criterion-referenced test\n**Criterion-referenced tests** assess a test taker’s performance in relation to a pre-determined standard or criterion. To pass the exam, test takers must achieve this level of performance, and their score is interpreted in relation to the criterion score rather than other test takers’ scores, as is the case with a [norm-referenced test](https://www.myenglishpages.com/glossary-assessment-terms/#norm-referenced-test).\n### 7\\. Diagnostic tests\nA diagnostic test refers to a test that aims at providing information about learners’ strengths and weaknesses. It is administered before teaching to diagnose students’ difficulties, guide lesson planning, and give a more efficient and effective course of instruction.\n### 8\\. Evaluation\nEvaluation refers to the process of collecting and interpreting information about the instruction, curriculum, or course.\nEvaluation can cover a wide range of topics in and outside of language instruction. For example, lessons, courses, programs, and skills can all be evaluated. Collecting, analyzing, and combining the various sorts of information would allow decision-makers to judge the success, viability, and cost-effectiveness of a course.\n### 9\\. Formative assessment\nFormative assessment is process-oriented. It is also known as ‘[assessment for learning](https://www.myenglishpages.com/blog/what-is-assessment-for-learning/).’ It refers to an ongoing process of monitoring learning with the goal of providing feedback to teachers in to improve their teaching methods and students’ learning.\n### 10\\. Non-standardized test\nAs opposed to [standardized tests](https://www.myenglishpages.com/glossary-assessment-terms/#standardized-test), non-standardized tests are designed to see to what extent learning has taken place but do not allow for a fairer comparison between students across different schools. Non-standardized testing is also known as informal testing. These are usually classroom tests that are created by the teacher rather than a group of outside testers.\n### 11\\. Norm-referenced test\nA **norm-referenced test** compares the results of test-takers to the results of other test-takers whose scores are given as the norm. This type of test contrasts with [criterion-referenced tests](https://www.myenglishpages.com/glossary-assessment-terms/#criterion-referenced-tests), where a test taker’s score is interpreted in relation to an agreed criterion score.\n### 12\\. Placement tests:\nA **placement test** is a test that is used to place students at the appropriate level of a program or course. The phrase “placement test” refers to the aim of a test rather than what it contains or how it is structured. For placement reasons, a variety of tools or testing procedures – such as dictation, an interview, or a grammar test – might be employed.\n### 13. Portfolio\nA **portfolio** is a purposeful collection of work that provides data about someone’s efforts, progress, or achievement in a given field. It is a tool that can be used for both learning and assessment.\n### 14. Proficiency tests\nA **proficiency test** is a test that determines how well someone has learned a language. A proficiency test differs from an achievement test in that the latter is used to determine how much a student has learned from a certain course or syllabus. A proficiency test is not related to a specific course of study, but rather assesses the learner’s overall language competency. Although earlier education and learning may have contributed to this, these elements are not the center of attention. Some proficiency tests, such as the American **TOEFL**, have been standardized for worldwide usage, and are used to assess the English language proficiency of overseas students wishing to study in the United States.\n### 15\\. Progress tests\nA **progress test** is a test that is associated with a specific set of teaching materials or a specific course of instruction. Teachers administer these tests at the end of a chapter, course, or term. They are similar to [achievement tests](https://www.myenglishpages.com/glossary-assessment-terms/#achievement-test), but their focus is narrower and more specific. They assist the teacher in assessing the effectiveness of his or her instruction and identifying the learners’ weaknesses.\n### 16\\. Reliability\n**Reliability** refers to the degree to which a test gives consistent results. A test is said to be reliable if it gives the same results when it is administered on different occasions and with different people.\n### 17. Rubric\nA **rubric** refers to the instructions which indicate to the student what he or she has to do to complete a task or activity.\n### 18. Standard\nA **standard** is commonly described as a level of quality or achievement, especially a level that is considered to be acceptable (_Collins Dictionary_).\nEducators describe standards as a type of educational aim (_The Longman dictionary of language teaching and applied linguistics_). They establish high targets for learning and determine expectations for success. By specifying standards, educators seek to raise levels of learning.\nCountries create national standards for achievement in many areas of the curriculum in order to promote educational accountability. These statements are thought to increase educational success by providing a clear definition of what should be taught and what level of performance should be anticipated across the school curriculum.\n### 19\\. Standardized tests\nStandardized tests are created with consistent questions and interpretations, and they are administered and scored in a predetermined, consistent manner.\nStandardized tests are frequently thought to be fairer than [non-standardized assessments](https://www.myenglishpages.com/glossary-assessment-terms/#non-standardized-assessments) because everyone receives the same test and grading system. These assessments are frequently regarded to be more objective and fairer than a system in which some students receive an easier test while others receive a more difficult test. Because everyone takes the same test, standardized assessments are meant to allow for reliable comparisons of results across all test takers.\n### 20\\. Summative assessment\nIt is product-oriented and is often referred to as an “_**assessment of learning**_“. It is used to measure student learning progress and achievement at the end of a specific instructional period by comparing it against a standard or benchmark.\nSummative assessment does not necessarily occur at the end of an entire course or module of study. Summative assessments may be delivered throughout a course, for example, after a particular unit (or set of topics) has been taught.\n### 21\\. Tests\nA test is a tool, technique, or method that measures a particular behavior, skill, aptitude, or set of objectives. The aim is to make a judgment about students’ performance, knowledge, or ability to complete a particular task. Tests must not be confused with assessment. While assessment is the process, tests are the actual tool that yields the results on the basis of which teachers make the appropriate judgments.\n### 22. Validity\nValidity refers to the extent to which a test measures what it is supposed to measure, or can be used successfully for the purposes for which it is intended.\n## Conclusion\nThe Assessment Glossary of Terms serves as a valuable resource for educators, students, and anyone seeking a clear understanding of assessment practices.
