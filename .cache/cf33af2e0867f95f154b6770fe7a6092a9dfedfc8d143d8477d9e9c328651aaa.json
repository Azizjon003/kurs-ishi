All studies have limitations of some sort, meaning declaring limitations doesn’t necessarily need to be a bad thing, so long as your declaration of limitations is well thought-out and explained.**\nRarely is a study perfect. Researchers [have to make trade-offs](https://helpfulprofessor.com/trade-off-examples/) when developing their studies, which are often based upon practical considerations such as time and monetary constraints, weighing the breadth of participants against the depth of insight, and choosing one methodology or another.\nIn research, studies can have limitations such as limited scope, researcher subjectivity, and lack of available research tools.\nAcknowledging the limitations of your study should be seen as a strength. It demonstrates your willingness for transparency, humility, and [submission to the](https://helpfulprofessor.com/scientific-method-examples/) [scientific method](https://helpfulprofessor.com/scientific-method-examples/) and can bolster the integrity of the study. It can also inform future research direction.\nTypically, scholars will explore the limitations of their study in either their methodology section, their conclusion section, or both.\nQualitative and quantitative research offer different perspectives and methods in exploring phenomena, each with its own strengths and limitations. So, I’ve split the limitations examples sections into qualitative and quantitative below.\n### Qualitative Research Limitations\n**[Qualitative research](https://helpfulprofessor.com/types-of-qualitative-research/) seeks to understand phenomena in-depth and in context. It focuses on the ‘why’ and ‘how’ questions.**\nIt’s often used to explore new or complex issues, and it provides rich, detailed insights into participants’ experiences, behaviors, and attitudes. However, these strengths also create certain limitations, as explained below.\n#### 1\\. Subjectivity\n**Qualitative research often requires the researcher to interpret subjective data. One researcher may examine a text and identify different themes or concepts as more dominant than others.**\nClose qualitative readings of texts are necessarily subjective – and while this may be a limitation, qualitative researchers argue this is the best way to deeply understand everything in context.\n****Suggested Solution and Response:**** To minimize subjectivity bias, you could consider cross-checking your own readings of themes and data against other scholars’ readings and interpretations. This may involve giving the raw data to a supervisor or colleague and asking them to code the data separately, then coming together to compare and contrast results.\n#### 2\\. Researcher Bias\n**The concept of researcher bias is related to, but slightly different from, subjectivity.**\nResearcher bias refers to the perspectives and opinions you bring with you when doing your research.\nFor example, a researcher who is explicitly of a certain philosophical or political persuasion may bring that persuasion to bear when interpreting data.\nIn many scholarly traditions, we will attempt to minimize researcher bias through the utilization of clear procedures that are set out in advance or through the use of statistical analysis tools.\nHowever, in other traditions, such as in [postmodern](https://helpfulprofessor.com/postmodernism-in-sociology/) [feminist research](https://helpfulprofessor.com/feminism-examples/), declaration of bias is expected, and acknowledgment of bias is seen as a positive because, in those traditions, it is believed that bias _cannot_ be eliminated from research, so instead, it is a matter of integrity to present it upfront.\n**Suggested Solution and Response:** Acknowledge the potential for researcher bias and, [depending on your theoretical framework](https://helpfulprofessor.com/theoretical-framework-examples/), accept this, or identify procedures you have taken to seek a closer approximation to objectivity in your coding and analysis.\n#### 3\\. Generalizability\n**If you’re struggling to find a limitation to discuss in your own qualitative research study, then this one is for you: all qualitative research, of all persuasions and perspectives, cannot be generalized.**\nThis is a core feature that sets qualitative data and [quantitative data](https://helpfulprofessor.com/quantitative-data-examples/) apart.\nThe point of qualitative data is to [select case studies](https://helpfulprofessor.com/case-study-advantages-and-disadvantages/) and similarly small corpora and dig deep through in-depth analysis and [thick description](https://helpfulprofessor.com/thick-description/) of data.\nOften, this will also mean that you have a non-randomized sample size.\nWhile this is a positive – you’re going to get some really deep, contextualized, interesting insights – it also means that the findings may not be generalizable to a larger population that may not be representative of the small group of people in your study.\n**Suggested Solution and Response:** Suggest future studies that take a quantitative approach to the question.\n#### 4\\. The Hawthorne Effect\n**The Hawthorne effect refers to the phenomenon where research participants change their [‘observed behavior’](https://helpfulprofessor.com/observable-behavior-examples/) when they’re aware that they are being observed.**\nThis effect was first identified by Elton Mayo who conducted studies of the effects of various factors ton workers’ productivity. He noticed that no matter what he did – turning up the lights, turning down the lights, etc. – there was an increase in worker outputs compared to prior to the study taking place.\nMayo realized that the mere act of observing the workers made them work harder – his observation was what was changing behavior.\nSo, if you’re looking for a potential limitation to name for your [observational research study](https://helpfulprofessor.com/observational-research-examples/), highlight the possible impact of the Hawthorne effect (and how you could reduce your footprint or visibility in order to decrease its likelihood).\n**Suggested Solution and Response:** Highlight ways you have attempted to reduce your footprint while in the field, and guarantee anonymity to your research participants.\n#### 5\\. Replicability\n**Quantitative research has a great benefit in that the studies are replicable – a researcher can get a similar sample size, duplicate the variables, and re-test a study. But you can’t do that in qualitative research.**\nQualitative research relies heavily on context – a specific case study or specific variables that make a certain instance worthy of analysis. As a result, it’s often difficult to re-enter the same setting with the same variables and repeat the study.\nFurthermore, the individual researcher’s interpretation is more influential in qualitative research, meaning even if a new researcher enters an environment and makes observations, their observations may be different because subjectivity comes into play much more. This doesn’t make the research bad necessarily (great insights can be made in qualitative research), but it certainly does demonstrate a weakness of qualitative research.\n**Suggested Solution and Response:** Suggest future studies that take a quantitative approach to the question.\n#### 6\\. Limited Scope\n**“Limited scope” is perhaps one of the most common limitations listed by researchers – and while this is often a catch-all way of saying, “well, I’m not studying that in _this_ study”, it’s also a valid point.**\nNo study can explore _everything_ related to a topic. At some point, we have to make decisions about what’s included _in_ the study and what is _excluded from_ the study.\nSo, you could say that a limitation of your study is that it doesn’t look at an extra variable or concept that’s certainly worthy of study but will have to be explored in your next project because this project has a clearly and narrowly defined goal.\n**Suggested Solution and Response:** Be clear about what’s in and out of the study when writing your research question.\n#### 7\\. Time Constraints\n**This is also a catch-all claim you can make about your research project: that you would have included more people in the study, looked at more variables, and so on. But you’ve got to submit this thing by the end of next semester! You’ve got time constraints.**\nAnd time constraints are a recognized reality in all research.\nBut this means you’ll need to explain how time has limited your decisions. As with “limited scope”, this may mean that you had to study a smaller group of subjects, limit the amount of time you spent in the field, and so forth.\n**Suggested Solution and Response:** Suggest future studies that will build on your current work, possibly as a PhD project.\n#### 8\\. Resource Intensiveness\n**Qualitative research can be expensive due to the cost of transcription, the involvement of trained researchers, and potential travel for interviews or observations.**\nSo, resource intensiveness is similar to the time constraints concept. If you don’t have the funds, you have to make decisions about which tools to use, which statistical software to employ, and how many research assistants you can dedicate to the study.\n**Suggested Solution and Response:** Suggest future studies that will gain more funding on the back of this ‘[exploratory study](https://helpfulprofessor.com/exploratory-research-examples/)‘.\n#### 9\\. Coding Difficulties\n**Data analysis in qualitative research often involves coding, which can be subjective and complex, especially when dealing with ambiguous or contradicting data.**\nAfter naming this as a limitation in your research, it’s important to explain how you’ve attempted to address this. Some ways to ‘limit the limitation’ include:\n-   **Triangulation:** Have 2 other researchers code the data as well and cross-check your results with theirs to identify outliers that may need to be re-examined, debated with the other researchers, or removed altogether.\n-   **Procedure:** Use a clear coding procedure to demonstrate reliability in your coding process. I personally use the thematic network analysis method outlined in [this academic article](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/David-Morgan-43/post/Which_qualitative_data_analysis_method_works_best_for_already_collected_data/attachment/59d622c979197b80779811ac/AS%3A303755013099520%401449432246985/download/Attride-Stirling+01+Thematic+Analysis+Nets.pdf) by Attride-Stirling (2001).\n**Suggested Solution and Response:** Triangulate your coding findings with colleagues, and follow a thematic network analysis procedure.\n#### 10\\. Risk of Non-Responsiveness\n**There is always a risk in research that research participants will be unwilling or uncomfortable sharing their genuine thoughts and feelings in the study.**\nThis is particularly true when you’re conducting research on sensitive topics, politicized topics, or topics where the participant is [expressing vulnerability](https://helpfulprofessor.com/vulnerability-examples/).\nThis is similar to the Hawthorne effect (aka participant bias), where participants change their behaviors in your presence; but it goes a step further, where participants actively hide their true thoughts and feelings from you.\n**Suggested Solution and Response:** One way to manage this is to try to include a wider group of people with the expectation that there will be non-responsiveness from some participants.\n#### 11\\. Risk of Attrition\n**Attrition refers to the process of losing research participants throughout the study.**\nThis occurs [most commonly in](https://helpfulprofessor.com/longitudinal-studies-examples/) [longitudinal studies](https://helpfulprofessor.com/longitudinal-studies-examples/), where a researcher must return to conduct their analysis over spaced periods of time, often over a period of years.\nThings happen to people over time – they move overseas, their life experiences change, they get sick, change their minds, and even die. The more time that passes, the greater the risk of attrition.\n**Suggested Solution and Response:** One way to manage this is to try to include a wider group of people with the expectation that there will be attrition over time.\n#### 12\\. Difficulty in Maintaining Confidentiality and Anonymity\n**Given the [detailed nature of qualitative data](https://helpfulprofessor.com/qualitative-data-examples/), ensuring participant anonymity can be challenging.**\nIf you have a sensitive topic in a specific case study, even anonymizing research participants sometimes isn’t enough. People might be able to induce who you’re talking about.\nSometimes, this will mean you have to exclude some interesting data that you collected from your final report. Confidentiality and anonymity come before your findings in research ethics – and this is a necessary limiting factor.\n**Suggested Solution and Response:** Highlight the efforts you have taken to anonymize data, and accept that confidentiality and accountability place extremely important constraints on academic research.\n#### 13\\. Difficulty in Finding Research Participants\n**A study that looks at a very specific phenomenon or even a specific set of cases within a phenomenon means that the pool of potential research participants can be very low.**\nCompile on top of this the fact that many people you approach may choose not to participate, and you could end up with a very small corpus of subjects to explore. This may limit your ability to make complete findings, even in a quantitative sense.\nYou may need to therefore limit [your research question and objectives](https://helpfulprofessor.com/research-objectives-examples/) to something more realistic.\n**Suggested Solution and Response:** Highlight that this is going to limit the study’s generalizability significantly.\n#### 14\\. Ethical Limitations\n**Ethical limitations refer to the things you cannot do based on ethical concerns identified either by yourself or your institution’s ethics review board.**\nThis might include threats to the physical or psychological well-being of your research subjects, the potential of releasing data that could harm a person’s reputation, and so on.\nFurthermore, even if your study follows all expected standards of ethics, you still, as an ethical researcher, need to allow a research participant to pull out at any point in time, after which you cannot use their data, which demonstrates an overlap between ethical constraints and participant attrition.\n**Suggested Solution and Response:** Highlight that these ethical limitations are inevitable but important to sustain the integrity of the research.\n_For more on Qualitative Research, Explore my [Qualitative Research Guide](https://helpfulprofessor.com/qualitative-research-examples/)_\n### Quantitative Research Limitations\n**Quantitative research focuses on quantifiable data and statistical, mathematical, or computational techniques. It’s often used to test hypotheses, assess relationships and causality, and generalize findings across larger populations.**\nQuantitative research is widely respected for its ability to provide reliable, measurable, and generalizable data (if done well!). Its structured methodology has strengths over qualitative research, such as the fact it allows for replication of the study, which underpins the validity of the research.\nHowever, this approach is not without it limitations, explained below.\n#### 1\\. Over-Simplification\n**Quantitative research is powerful because it allows you to measure and analyze data in a systematic and standardized way. However, one of its limitations is that it can sometimes simplify complex phenomena or situations.**\nIn other words, it might miss the subtleties or nuances of the research subject.\nFor example, if you’re studying why people choose a particular diet, a quantitative study might identify factors like age, income, or health status. But it might miss other aspects, [such as cultural influences](https://helpfulprofessor.com/cultural-influence-examples/) or personal beliefs, that can also significantly impact dietary choices.\nWhen writing about this limitation, you can say that your quantitative approach, while providing precise measurements and comparisons, may not capture the full complexity of your subjects of study.\n****Suggested Solution and Response:**** Suggest a follow-up case study using the same research participants in order to gain additional context and depth.\n#### 2\\. Lack of Context\n**Another potential issue with quantitative research is that it often focuses on numbers and statistics at the expense of context or qualitative information.**\nLet’s say you’re studying the effect of classroom size on student performance. You might find that students in smaller classes generally perform better. However, this doesn’t take into account other variables, like [teaching style](https://helpfulprofessor.com/types-of-teaching-styles/), student motivation, or family support.\nWhen describing this limitation, you might say, “Although our research provides important insights into the relationship between class size and student performance, it does not incorporate the impact of other potentially influential variables. Future research could benefit from a mixed-methods approach that combines quantitative analysis with qualitative insights.”\n**Suggested Solution and Response:** Suggest a follow-up case study using the same research participants in order to gain additional context and depth.\n#### 3\\. Applicability to Real-World Settings\n**Oftentimes, experimental research takes place in controlled environments to limit the influence of outside factors.**\nThis control is great for isolation and understanding the specific phenomenon but can limit the applicability or [“external validity”](https://helpfulprofessor.com/external-validation/) of the research to real-world settings.\nFor example, if you conduct a lab experiment to see how sleep deprivation impacts cognitive performance, the sterile, controlled lab environment might not reflect real-world conditions where people are dealing with multiple stressors.\nTherefore, when explaining the limitations of your quantitative study in your methodology section, you could state:\n“While our findings provide valuable information about \\[topic\\], the controlled conditions of the experiment may not accurately represent real-world scenarios where [extraneous variables](https://helpfulprofessor.com/extraneous-variables-examples/) will exist. As such, the direct applicability of our results to broader contexts may be limited.”\n**Suggested Solution and Response:** Suggest future studies that will engage in real-world observational research, such as ethnographic research.\n#### 4\\. Limited Flexibility\n**Once a quantitative study is underway, it can be challenging to make changes to it. This is because, unlike in grounded research, you’re putting in place your study in advance, and you can’t make changes part-way through.**\nYour study design, data collection methods, and analysis techniques need to be decided upon before you start collecting data.\nFor example, if you are conducting a survey on the impact of social media on teenage mental health, and halfway through, you realize that you should have included a question about their screen time, it’s generally too late to add it.\nWhen discussing this limitation, you could write something like, “The structured nature of our quantitative approach allows for consistent data collection and analysis but also limits our flexibility to adapt and modify the research process in response to emerging insights and ideas.”\n**Suggested Solution and Response:** Suggest future studies that will use mixed-methods or qualitative [research methods](https://helpfulprofessor.com/research-methodology-examples/) to gain additional depth of insight.\n#### 5\\. Risk of Survey Error\n**Surveys are a common tool in quantitative research, but they carry risks of error.**\nThere can be measurement errors (if a question is misunderstood), coverage errors (if some groups aren’t adequately represented), non-response errors (if certain people don’t respond), and sampling errors (if your sample isn’t representative of the population).\nFor instance, if you’re surveying college students about [their study habits](https://helpfulprofessor.com/good-study-habits/), but only daytime students respond because you conduct the survey during the day, your results will be skewed.\nIn discussing this limitation, you might say, “Despite our best efforts to develop a comprehensive survey, there remains a risk of survey error, including measurement, coverage, non-response, and sampling errors. These could potentially impact the reliability and generalizability of our findings.”\n**Suggested Solution and Response:** Suggest future studies that will use other survey tools to compare and contrast results.\n#### 6\\. Limited Ability to Probe Answers\n**With quantitative research, you typically can’t ask follow-up questions or delve deeper into participants’ responses like you could in a qualitative interview.**\nFor instance, imagine you are surveying 500 students about study habits in a questionnaire. A respondent might indicate that they study for two hours each night. You might want to follow up by asking them to elaborate on what those study sessions involve or how effective they feel their habits are.\nHowever, quantitative research generally disallows this in the way a qualitative semi-structured interview could.\nWhen discussing this limitation, you might write, “Given the structured nature of our survey, our ability to probe deeper into individual responses is limited. This means we may not fully understand the context or reasoning behind the responses, potentially limiting the depth of our findings.”\n**Suggested Solution and Response:** Suggest future studies that engage in mixed-method or [qualitative methodologies](https://helpfulprofessor.com/qualitative-methods-examples/) to address the issue from another angle.\n#### 7\\. Reliance on Instruments for Data Collection\n**In quantitative research, the collection of data heavily relies on instruments like questionnaires, surveys, or machines.**\nThe limitation here is that the data you get is only as good as the instrument you’re using. If the instrument isn’t designed or calibrated well, your data can be flawed.\nFor instance, if you’re using a questionnaire to study customer satisfaction and the questions are vague, confusing, or biased, the responses may not accurately reflect the customers’ true feelings.\nWhen discussing this limitation, you could say, “Our study depends on the use of questionnaires for data collection. Although we have put significant effort into designing and testing the instrument, it’s possible that inaccuracies or misunderstandings could potentially affect the validity of the data collected.”\n**Suggested Solution and Response:** Suggest future studies that will use different instruments but examine the same variables to triangulate results.\n#### 8\\. Time and Resource Constraints (Specific to Quantitative Research)\n**Quantitative research can be time-consuming and resource-intensive, especially when dealing with large samples.**\nIt often involves systematic sampling, rigorous design, and sometimes complex statistical analysis.\nIf resources and time are limited, it can restrict the scale of your research, the techniques you can employ, or the extent of your data analysis.\nFor example, you may want to conduct a nationwide survey on public opinion about a certain policy. However, due to limited resources, you might only be able to survey people in one city.\nWhen writing about this limitation, you could say, “Given the scope of our research and the resources available, we are limited to conducting our survey within one city, which may not fully represent the nationwide public opinion. Hence, the generalizability of the results may be limited.”\n**Suggested Solution and Response:** Suggest future studies that will have more funding or longer timeframes.\n## How to Discuss Your Research Limitations\n### 1\\. In your Research Proposal and Methodology Section\nIn the research proposal, which will become the methodology section of your dissertation, I would recommend taking the four following steps, in order:\n-   **Be Explicit about your Scope –** If you limit the scope of your study in your research question, aims, and objectives, then you can set yourself up well later in the methodology to say that certain questions are “outside the scope of the study.” For example, you may identify the fact that the study doesn’t address a certain variable, but you can follow up by stating that the research question is specifically focused on the variable that you _are_ examining, so this limitation would need to be looked at in future studies.\n-   **Acknowledge the Limitation –** Acknowledging the limitations of your study demonstrates reflexivity and humility and can make your research more reliable and valid. It also pre-empts questions the people grading your paper may have, so instead of them down-grading you for your limitations; they will congratulate you on explaining the limitations and how you have addressed them!\n-   **Explain your Decisions –** You may have chosen your approach (despite its limitations) for a very specific reason. This might be because your approach remains, on balance, the best one to answer your research question. Or, it might be because of time and monetary constraints that are outside of your control.\n-   **Highlight the Strengths of your Approach –** Conclude your limitations section by strongly demonstrating that, despite limitations, you’ve worked hard to minimize the effects of the limitations and that you have chosen your specific approach and methodology because it’s also got some terrific strengths. Name the strengths.\nOverall, you’ll want to acknowledge your own limitations but also explain that the limitations don’t detract from the value of your study as it stands.\n### 2\\. In the Conclusion Section or Chapter\nIn the conclusion of your study, it is generally expected that you return to a discussion of the study’s limitations. Here, I recommend the following steps:\n-   **Acknowledge issues faced –** After completing your study, you will be increasingly aware of issues you may have faced that, if you re-did the study, you may have addressed earlier in order to avoid those issues. Acknowledge these issues as limitations, and frame them as recommendations for subsequent studies.\n-   **Suggest further research –** Scholarly research aims to fill gaps in the current literature and knowledge. Having established your expertise through your study, suggest lines of inquiry for future researchers. You could state that your study had certain limitations, and “future studies” can address those limitations.\n-   **Suggest a mixed methods approach –** Qualitative and quantitative research each have pros and cons. So, note those ‘cons’ of your approach, then say the next study should approach the topic using the opposite methodology or could approach it using a mixed-methods approach that could achieve the benefits of quantitative studies with the nuanced insights of associated qualitative insights as part of an in-study case-study.\nOverall, be clear about both your limitations and how those limitations can inform future studies.\n## Conclusion\nIn sum, [each type of research method](https://helpfulprofessor.com/types-of-research-methods/) has its own strengths and limitations. Qualitative research excels in exploring depth, context, and complexity, while quantitative research excels in examining breadth, generalizability, and quantifiable measures. Despite their individual limitations, each method contributes unique and valuable insights, and researchers often use them together to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the phenomenon being studied.\n## References\nAttride-Stirling, J.
