Limitations may also be the result of unanticipated challenges that emerged while conducting the study.\n---\nPrice, James H. and Judy Murnan. “Research Limitations and the Necessity of Reporting Them.” _American Journal of Health Education_ 35 (2004): 66-67; Theofanidis, Dimitrios and Antigoni Fountouki. \"Limitations and Delimitations in the Research Process.\" _Perioperative Nursing_ 7 (September-December 2018): 155-163..\n## Importance of...\n**Describing the limitations of a study are important for the following reasons:**\n**Always acknowledge a study's limitations.** It is far better that you identify and acknowledge your study’s limitations than to have them pointed out by your professor and have your grade lowered because you appeared to have ignored them or didn't realize they existed.\n**Keep in mind that acknowledgment of a study's limitations is an opportunity to make suggestions for further research.** If you do connect your study's limitations to the need for further research, be sure to explain the ways in which these unanswered questions have become clearer and more focused as a result of your study.\n**Acknowledgment of a study's limitations also provides you with opportunities** **to demonstrate that you have thought critically about the research problem**, understood the relevant literature published about it, and correctly assessed the methods chosen for studying the problem. A key objective of the research process is not only describe new knowledge and insight, but to confront assumptions and explore what we don't know, even after completing a study.\n**Claiming limitations is a subjective process because you must evaluate the impact of those limitations**. Don't just list key challenges and the magnitude of a study's limitations. To do so diminishes the validity of your research because it leaves the reader wondering whether, or in what ways, those limitation(s) may have impacted your results and conclusions. Limitations require a critical, overall appraisal and interpretation of their impact. You should answer the question: do these problems with errors, methods, validity, etc. matter and, if so, to what extent?\n---\nPrice, James H. and Judy Murnan. “Research Limitations and the Necessity of Reporting Them.” _American Journal of Health Education_ 35 (2004): 66-67; Structure: How to Structure the Research Limitations Section of Your Dissertation. Dissertations and Theses: An Online Textbook. Laerd.com.\n## Descriptions of Possible Limitations\n**All studies have limitations**. However, it is important that you restrict your discussion to limitations related to the research problem under investigation. For example, if a meta-analysis of existing literature is not a stated purpose of your research, it should not be discussed as a limitation. **Do not apologize for not addressing issues that you did not promise to investigate in the introduction of your paper.**\nHere are examples of limitations related to methodology and the research process you may need to describe and discuss how they possibly impacted your results. Note that descriptions of limitations should be stated in the past tense because they were discovered after you completed your research.\n**Possible Methodological Limitations**\n-   **Sample size** -- the number of the units of analysis you use in your study is dictated by the type of research problem you are investigating. Note that, if your sample size is too small, it will be difficult to find significant relationships from the data, as statistical tests normally require a larger sample size to ensure a representative distribution of the population and to be considered representative of groups of people to whom results will be generalized or transferred. Note that sample size is generally less relevant in qualitative research if explained in the context of the research problem.\n-   **Lack of available and/or reliable data** -- a lack of data or of reliable data will likely require you to limit the scope of your analysis, the size of your sample, or it can be a significant obstacle in finding a trend and a meaningful relationship. You need to not only describe these limitations but provide cogent reasons why you believe data is missing or is unreliable. However, don’t just throw up your hands in frustration; use this as an opportunity to describe a need for future research based on designing a different method for gathering data.\n-   **Lack of prior research studies on the topic** -- citing prior research studies forms the basis of your literature review and helps lay a foundation for understanding the research problem you are investigating. Depending on the currency or scope of your research topic, there may be little, if any, prior research on your topic. **Before assuming this to be true, though, consult with a librarian!** In cases when a librarian has confirmed that there is little or no prior research, you may be required to develop an entirely new research typology \\[for example, using an exploratory rather than an explanatory **[research design](https://libguides.usc.edu/writingguide/researchdesigns)**\\]. Note again that discovering a limitation can serve as an important opportunity to identify new gaps in the literature and to describe the need for further research.\n-   **Measure used to collect the data** \\-- sometimes it is the case that, after completing your interpretation of the findings, you discover that the way in which you gathered data inhibited your ability to conduct a thorough analysis of the results. For example, you regret not including a specific question in a survey that, in retrospect, could have helped address a particular issue that emerged later in the study. Acknowledge the deficiency by stating a need for future researchers to revise the specific method for gathering data.\n-   **Self-reported data** \\-- whether you are relying on pre-existing data or you are conducting a qualitative research study and gathering the data yourself, self-reported data is limited by the fact that it rarely can be independently verified. In other words, you have to the accuracy of what people say, whether in interviews, focus groups, or on questionnaires, at face value. However, self-reported data can contain several potential sources of bias that you should be alert to and note as limitations. These biases become apparent if they are incongruent with data from other sources. These are: (1) **selective memory** \\[remembering or not remembering experiences or events that occurred at some point in the past\\]; (2) **telescoping** \\[recalling events that occurred at one time as if they occurred at another time\\]; (3) **attribution** \\[the act of attributing positive events and outcomes to one's own agency, but attributing negative events and outcomes to external forces\\]; and, (4) **exaggeration** \\[the act of representing outcomes or embellishing events as more significant than is actually suggested from other data\\].\n---\n**Possible Limitations of the Researcher**\n-   **Access** -- if your study depends on having access to people, organizations, data, or documents and, for whatever reason, access is denied or limited in some way, the reasons for this needs to be described. Also, include an explanation why being denied or limited access did not prevent you from following through on your study.\n-   **Longitudinal effects** \\-- unlike your professor, who can literally devote years \\[even a lifetime\\] to studying a single topic, the time available to investigate a research problem and to measure change or stability over time is constrained by the due date of your assignment. Be sure to choose a research problem that does not require an excessive amount of time to complete the literature review, apply the methodology, and gather and interpret the results. If you're unsure whether you can complete your research within the confines of the assignment's due date, talk to your professor.\n-   **Cultural and other type of bias** -- we all have biases, whether we are conscience of them or not. Bias is when a person, place, event, or thing is viewed or shown in a consistently inaccurate way. Bias is usually negative, though one can have a positive bias as well, especially if that bias reflects your reliance on research that only support your hypothesis. When proof-reading your paper, be especially critical in reviewing how you have stated a problem, selected the data to be studied, what may have been omitted, the manner in which you have ordered events, people, or places, how you have chosen to represent a person, place, or thing, to name a phenomenon, or to use possible words with a positive or negative connotation. **NOTE****:** If you detect bias in prior research, it must be acknowledged and you should explain what measures were taken to avoid perpetuating that bias. For example, if a previous study only used boys to examine how music education supports effective math skills, describe how your research expands the study to include girls.\n-   **Fluency in a language** -- if your research focuses, for example, on measuring the perceived value of after-school tutoring among Mexican-American ESL \\[English as a Second Language\\] students and you are not fluent in Spanish, you are limited in being able to read and interpret Spanish language research studies on the topic or to speak with these students in their primary language. This type of limitation should be acknowledged.\n---\nAguinis, Hermam and Jeffrey R.

S. _Chance and Probability: The Limitations of the Social Sciences_. New Delhi: Concept Publishing Company, 2011.\n## Structure and Writing Style\n**Information about the limitations of your study** are generally placed either at the beginning of the discussion section of your paper so the reader knows and understands them before reading the rest of your analysis of the findings, or, the limitations are outlined at the conclusion of the discussion section as an acknowledgement of the need for further study. Statements about a study's limitations should not be buried in the body \\[middle\\] of the discussion section unless a limitation is specific to something covered in that part of the paper. If this is the case, though, the limitation should be reiterated at the conclusion of the section.\n**If you determine that your study is flawed due to important limitations**, such as, an inability to acquire critical data, consider reframing it as an exploratory study intended to lay the groundwork for a more complete study in the future. Be sure, though, to specifically explain the ways that these flaws can be successfully overcome in a new study.\n**But, do not use limitations as an excuse for not develo a thorough research paper!** Review the tab in this guide for [developing a research topic](https://libguides.usc.edu/content.php?pid=83009). If serious, known limitations exist, it generally indicates a likelihood that your research problem is too narrowly defined or that the issue or event under study is too recent and, thus, very little research has been written about it. If serious unanticipated limitations do emerge, consult with your professor about possible ways to overcome them or how to revise your study.\n**When discussing the limitations of your research, be sure to:**\n-   Describe each limitation in detailed but concise terms;\n-   Explain why each limitation exists;\n-   Provide the reasons why each limitation could not be overcome using the method(s) chosen to acquire or gather the information \\[cite to and note other studies that had similar problems when possible\\];\n-   Assess the impact of each limitation in relation to the overall findings and conclusions of your study; and,\n-   If appropriate, describe how these limitations could point to the need for further research.\n**Remember that the method you chose may be the source of a significant limitation that has emerged during your interpretation of the results** \\[for example, you didn't interview a group of people that you later wish you had\\]. If this is the case, don't panic. Acknowledge it, and explain how applying a different or more robust methodological technique might address the research problem more effectively in a future study. A underlying goal of scholarly research is not only to show what works, but to demonstrate what doesn't work or what needs further clarification.\n---\nAguinis, Hermam and Jeffrey R. Edwards. “Methodological Wishes for the Next Decade and How to Make Wishes Come True.” _Journal of Management Studies_ 51 (January 2014): 143-174; Brutus, Stéphane et al. \"Self-Reported Limitations and Future Directions in Scholarly Reports: Analysis and Recommendations.\" _Journal of Management_ 39 (January 2013): 48-75; Ioannidis, John P.A. \"Limitations are not Properly Acknowledged in the Scientific Literature.\" _Journal of Clinical Epidemiology_ 60 (2007): 324-329; Pasek, Josh.

Purdue University.\n## Writing Tip\n**Don't Inflate the Importance of Your Findings!**\nAfter all the hard work and long hours devoted to writing your research paper, it is easy to get carried away with attributing unwarranted importance to what you’ve done. We all want our academic work to be viewed as excellent and worthy of a good grade, but it is important that you understand and openly acknowledge the limitations of your study. Inflating the importance of your study's findings by ignoring or downplaying limitations could be perceived by your readers as an attempt hide its flaws or encourage a biased interpretation of the results. A small measure of humility goes a long way!\n---\nTanner, Ralph E. S. _Chance and Probability: The Limitations of the Social Sciences_. New Delhi: Concept Publishing Company, 2011.\n## Another Writing Tip\n**Negative Results are Not a Limitation!**\nNegative evidence refers to findings that unexpectedly challenge rather than support your hypothesis. If you didn't get the results you anticipated, it may mean your hypothesis was incorrect and needs to be reformulated. Or, as is often the case, you have stumbled onto something unexpected that warrants further study. Moreover, the absence of an effect may be very telling in many situations, particularly in experimental research designs. In any case, your results may very well be of importance to others even though they did not support your initial assumptions. Do not fall into the trap of thinking that results contrary to what you expected is a limitation to your study. If you carried out the research well, they are simply your results and only require additional interpretation in the discussion section of your paper.\n---\nLewis, George H. and Jonathan F. Lewis. “The Dog in the Night-Time: Negative Evidence in Social Research.” _The British Journal of Sociology_ 31 (December 1980): 544-558; Lehrer, David et al. \"Negative Results in Social Science.\" _European Political Science_ 6 (February 2007): 51-68.\n## Yet Another Writing Tip\n**Sample Size Limitations in Qualitative Research**\nSample sizes are typically smaller in qualitative research because, as the study goes on, acquiring more data does not necessarily lead to more information. This is because one occurrence of a piece of data, or a code, is all that is necessary to ensure that it becomes part of the analysis framework. However, it remains true that sample sizes that are too small cannot adequately support claims of having achieved valid conclusions and sample sizes that are too large do not permit the deep, naturalistic, and inductive analysis that defines qualitative inquiry. Determining adequate sample size in qualitative research is ultimately a matter of judgment and experience in evaluating the quality of the information collected against the uses to which it will be applied and the particular research method and purposeful sampling strategy employed. If the sample size is found to be a limitation, it may reflect your judgment about the methodological technique chosen \\[e.g., single life history study versus focus group interviews\\] rather than the number of respondents used.\n---\nBoddy, Clive Roland. \"Sample Size for Qualitative Research.\" _Qualitative Market Research: An International Journal_ 19 (2016): 426-432; Huberman, A.
