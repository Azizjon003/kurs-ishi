NeoSoft provides Selenium scripts to replicate user behaviors such as button clicks, data entry, and page navigation.\nThis automation allows thorough regression testing whenever new code is deployed to catch bugs.\n**Appium** – For testing mobile apps, NeoSoft uses Appium to automate interactions on native, hybrid, and mobile web apps.\nTouch actions, gestures, device rotations, and more can all be automated for reliable mobile testing.\n**API testing** – NeoSoft automates API testing using Postman and other tools.\nCollection runners execute sequence API calls and validate responses.\nThis finds issues with integration points between frontends and backends.\n**Unit testing** – Developers utilize frameworks like NUnit and JUnit to automate unit tests at the code level.\nThis catches bugs early before they propagate downstream.\n**Virtual services** – Mock servers and virtual services simulate dependencies like databases and Microservices.\nThis facilitates automated integration testing without needing full environments.\nBy combining these different forms of automation, NeoSoft achieves comprehensive test coverage.\nTheir automated regression suite can execute overnight or over a weekend to validate new builds.\nEngineers receive feedback on bugs soon after checking in code changes. This allows rapid iterations and fixes, leading to higher-quality software.\n### AI Testing at QA Mentor\nQA Mentor, a leader in software testing solutions, has used artificial intelligence (AI) to accelerate their testing processes.\nThey employ AI-powered tools to automate test creation and maintenance.\nThis eliminates much of the manual work associated with developing and updating test scripts.\nBy incorporating AI and machine learning into testing, QA Mentor has also been able to expand test coverage and detect defects that human testers would likely overlook.\nFor instance, the AI testing tools can automatically test all possible permutations of input combinations.\nThis enables more comprehensive testing with less effort compared to manual testing.\nSome examples of how QA Mentor applies AI to achieve better testing outcomes:\n**Automatic test case creation** – Instead of engineers manually coding test scripts, the QA Mentor uses AI tools that observe real user interactions and generate test cases based on those sessions. This instantly creates a suite of reusable tests.\n**Self-healing tests** – Tests powered by AI can self-heal when application changes occur.\nFor example, if a locator or assertion needs updating, the AI will automatically flag it and make corrections to keep the tests running.\n**Anomaly detection** – Machine learning algorithms profile normal application performance and can detect anomalies that indicate a defect. This finds bugs that traditional tests would miss.\n**Test data generation** – QA Mentor leverages AI to automatically generate relevant test data rather than rely on engineers defining all possible test inputs. Smart data selection expands coverage.\n**Chatbot testing** – Natural language conversations simulate real user interactions.\nBots help identify linguistic bugs that slip through standard testing.\n**Exploratory testing** – AI analyzes app usage and guides testers to execute sessions most likely to reveal new defects. This optimizes manual exploratory testing.\n### Crowdsourced Testing at Qualitrix\nQualitrix, a renowned software testing company, has adopted crowdsourced testing to substantially expand its testing capabilities.\nThey leverage online communities of testers to test applications on a wide variety of devices and platforms.\nThis crowdsourced approach allows Qualitrix to test localized versions of their clients’ apps to ensure they work well across global markets.\nQualitrix utilizes crowdsourced testers located in target countries to provide feedback from real users who speak the local language, know the culture, and test on relevant devices.\n**Some key ways Qualitrix applies crowdsourced testing:**\n**Diverse test devices** – By tapping into the crowd, Qualitrix can test apps on many different device makes, models, and operating system versions.\nLocal crowd testers provide coverage for key devices popular in their country.\n**Native language testing** – Testers evaluate localized app versions in their native language to catch translation bugs and issues with regional formats for date, currency, etc.\nThis is far more effective than having a translator do QA.\n**Real-world testing** – Crowd testers use the app like an actual user would in realistic scenarios.\nThey find defects that occur under real-world conditions which may not be replicated by in-house testers.\n**Location-based testing** – Testing apps in different geographical regions exposes bugs tied to networks, carriers, GPS/mapping, weather, and other location-specific factors.\n**Faster feedback** – Crowd testing can be scaled up and down on demand to provide quick validation during development sprints or major releases. Bugs are found sooner.\n**Reduced costs** – Crowdsourced testing is more flexible and cost-effective compared to hiring full-time in-house QA resources for certain types of testing activities and needs.\nBy leveraging a diverse crowd of global testers, Qualitrix can test localized app versions on more configurations under real usage conditions.\n### Microservices Testing at Cigniti\nCigniti, a global leader in QA services, has embraced Microservices architecture for many of its software projects.\nThey utilize containerization with Docker and orchestration tools like Kubernetes to develop and deploy Microservices.\nThis provides greater flexibility to enhance and scale applications faster compared to monolithic architectures.\nHowever, Microservices also pose new testing challenges. To effectively test Microservices, Cigniti uses principles and practices of shifting left.\nThey focus on testing Microservices early at the API layer during development.\nThis allows defects to be detected and fixed before downstream impacts occur.\nCigniti also relies heavily on automation to handle the growing **[volume of Microservices testing services](https://www.aegissofttech.com/testing/microservices-qa.html)**.\nSpecific testing strategies Cigniti applies for Microservices:\n**Unit testing** – Developers create unit tests for each Microservices to validate functionality and prevent defects before integration. Test-driven development (TDD) is widely used.\n**API testing** – API tests for each Microservices are automated using Postman, RestAssured, and similar tools. Teams validate interfaces between Microservices this way.\n**Integration testing** – As Microservices are combined, integration points are tested to find issues with cross-service data flows. Automated mocks and stubs simulate dependencies.\n**Contract testing** – Schemas and contracts between Microservices are strongly validated to prevent interface breaks as code changes.\n**Security testing** – Microservices open up many new attack surfaces that must be tested for vulnerabilities like injection, broken auth, etc.\n**Load testing** – Microservices have to be rigorously load-tested for scalability. Spikes in user volume may impact certain services.\n**Monitoring** – In production, Microservices are monitored closely for performance indicators and errors to catch defects after deployment.\nMicroservices enable more frequent releases while rigorous API testing reduces risk.\nBy excelling at Microservices testing, Cigniti has delivered significant advantages for their clients around agility and quality.\nAs these real-world examples demonstrate, companies can gain huge testing benefits from adopting the latest QA technologies and methodologies like automation, AI, crowdsourcing, and Microservices testing.\nThese key trends enable organizations to maximize test coverage, defects found, and overall efficiency.\nCompanies that embrace modern testing practices are better positioned to release higher-quality software at speed.\nThis in turn allows them to accelerate innovation, reduce costs, and gain a competitive advantage.\nWhat emerging testing approaches and tools are you considering to enhance QA results?
