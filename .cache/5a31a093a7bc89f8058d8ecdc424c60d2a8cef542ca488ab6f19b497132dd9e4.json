The appearance of too many ellipses can diminish their impact. So, save the ellipses for those times when you really need to emphasize a dialogue disruption. Remember that [em dashes](https://erinwrightwriting.com/2013/08/how-to-use-a-dash/) can also be used to signal dialogue interruptions.3\n**Reserve ellipses for the middle and end of dialogue lines.** Ellipses aren’t typically used at the start of a line of dialogue. If you need to indicate that the speaker faltered before speaking, do so through descriptive text before or after the dialogue.\n**Maintain consistent ellipses spacing.** Follow your primary [style guide](https://erinwrightwriting.com/which-style-guide-is-best/ \"Which Style Guide Is Best for You?\"), house style guide, or publisher’s guidelines when deciding how to space ellipsis points. If you’re not following a specific guide, choose one format to maintain consistency throughout your document. Two common formats are\n1.  equally spaced points with one space before and after each set (i.e., “Hello **. . .** there”) or\n2.  unspaced points with one space before and after each set (i.e., “Hello **…** there”).\nConsistent point spacing is also important for ellipses in quotations; however, the guidelines for quotations are more specific because ellipses serve more functions in quotations than in dialogue. The first four parts of this series describe a variety of ways to use ellipses in quotations.\n[How to Use Ellipses, Part 1: Ellipses within and between Quoted Sentences](https://erinwrightwriting.com/2016/01/how-to-use-ellipses-part-1/)\n[How to Use Ellipses, Part 2: Ellipses between Quoted Paragraphs](https://erinwrightwriting.com/2016/02/how-to-use-ellipses-part-2-ellipses-between-quoted-paragraphs/)\n[How to Use Ellipses, Part 3: Ellipses at the Beginning and End of Quoted Sentences](https://erinwrightwriting.com/2016/03/title-use-ellipses-part-3-ellipses-beginning-end-quoted-sentences/)\n[How to Use Ellipses, Part 4: Ellipses in Brackets](https://erinwrightwriting.com/2016/03/how-to-use-ellipses-part-4-ellipses-in-brackets/)\n## References\n1\\. _The Chicago Manual of Style_, 17th ed.
