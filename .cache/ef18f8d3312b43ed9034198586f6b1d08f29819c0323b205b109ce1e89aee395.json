You’ve planned out your ingredients and recipe, but before you start cooking, you need to make sure your kitchen is organized and all the kitchen tools and accessories you need is within reach. This is where test implementation comes in, the crucial stage of software testing where the test plan is put into action. Just like a chef, the test manager should ensure that everything required for testing is ready and testers can start testing.\nIn this article, we will discuss what test implementation is and its pros and cons in detail. Let’s get started.\nTable Of Contents\n-   [0.1 What is Test Implementation?](#What_is_Test_Implementation)\n-   [0.2 Responsibilities of a Test Manager in the Test Implementation Phase](#Responsibilities_of_a_Test_Manager_in_the_Test_Implementation_Phase)\n-   [0.3 Test Implementation and Test Automation](#Test_Implementation_and_Test_Automation)\n-   [1 Disadvantages of Early Test Implementation](#Disadvantages_of_Early_Test_Implementation)\n-   [2 Advantages of Early Test Implementation](#Advantages_of_Early_Test_Implementation)\n-   [3 Major Tasks Involved In Test Implementation](#Major_Tasks_Involved_In_Test_Implementation)\n-   [4 Summary](#Summary)\n-   [5 Frequently Asked Questions](#Frequently_Asked_Questions)\n### What is Test Implementation?\nTest implementation is a process of organizing and prioritizing tests and creating test data. Sometimes, if necessary, it also involves preparing test harnesses and creating automated test scripts.\nDuring this stage, the Test Analyst or Test Manager makes sure that all the prerequisites are handled to initiate the test execution. They then implement the test designs as test cases, test procedures, and test data, which are then executed to verify the functionality of the software.\nIt is crucial to choose the right tests and execute them in the right order. Also, this is vital while using risk-based strategies, where testers prioritize tests based on the risks and problems.\nIf you are following the [IEEE829](https://standards.ieee.org/ieee/829/3787/) standard, then you must define the below parameters too,\n-   Test inputs\n-   Expected test results, and\n-   Steps to follow for each test process\nThese will be documented together, and test data will be stored in database tables, flat files, etc.\n### Responsibilities of a Test Manager in the Test Implementation Phase\nAnother important part of the implementation phase is that the Test Manager should ensure that the testing team is ready to execute the test design.\nThe following are some of the responsibilities of a Test Manager in this phase:\n-   Ensuring that all the test procedures are organized and available to testers.\n-   A guideline of who will execute what test cases, when, and test data for testing.\n-   Finalizing the timeline of test execution\n-   Ensuring that the tools to be used by testers are in place\n-   Ensuring that the test environment for executing test data is in place\n-   Are the test cases documented and reviewed?\n-   Ensuring that the test environment is configured to the guidelines\n-   Preparing a schedule for test execution, describing the order for execution of manual and automated tests.\n-   Checking for constraints like risks and priorities\n### Test Implementation and Test Automation\nTest implementation is not just about manual testing. It involves creating automated testing scripts as well. Automated testing should be properly implemented to ensure a good ROI (Return on Investment).In this stage, the Test Managers define the priority and the execution order of the manual and automation tests. Not just that, even the acquisition of tools required for testing, like automation testing tool, test data generation tool, framework, and more, is done in this stage.\n[Testsigma](https://testsigma.com/) is a powerful test automation platform that lets you automate web, mobile, and desktop apps and APIs in one place. It allows you to create test cases in plain English statements as it supports **Natural Language Processing**. This makes editing, removing, or updating the test cases at any stage very easy.\n![Testsigma](https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/blog-assets-production.testsigma.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/migrated_images/image_f1855eb8fb739a48289f4b0c8e435912_2000.png_1748948267.png)\nThe following are some of the [features of Testsigma](https://testsigma.com/features),\n-   It is a no-code platform, so no coding skills are required for testing.

This will make the entire test implementation ineffective.\n-   Not just the Agile life cycle, using an iterative software development lifecycle will also affect the code between iterations.\n-   The above scenarios will make the predefined tests obsolete and might require continuous maintenance.\n-   Even while using a sequential life cycle like the Waterfall model for product development, if the project is not managed properly and if the requirements keep changing later, then early test implementation is ineffective.\nHence, the Test Manager must consider the below factors before the test implementation process,\n-   Identify the type of Software development life cycle used for product development\n-   Features that require testing\n-   Define how frequently the requirements may change in the later stages of the project lifecycle\n-   Possibility of code changes between two iterations\n## Advantages of Early Test Implementation\nEarly test implementation is a good practice. Let’s discuss some of the advantages of early test implementation,\n-   Concrete test cases provide practical examples of how the application behaves.\n-   Also, domain experts find it simple and easy to verify concrete tests rather than non-concrete business rules.\n-   It helps identify any weaknesses in software specifications.\n-   It further promotes collaboration between testers, developers, and other members of the project team.\n_Note – If you’re wondering what a concrete test case is, a concrete test case is a specific test scenario with predefined input values, expected results, and execution steps._\n## Major Tasks Involved in Test Implementation\nThe following are some of the major tasks involved in test implementation,\n-   Develop and prioritize test procedures.\n-   Prepare [Test Harness](https://testsigma.com/blog/test-harness/)\n-   Create test suites from test procedures.\n-   Prepare test data for test execution.\n-   Finalize, implement, and prioritize test cases.\n-   Create automated test scripts. Using a powerful test automation platform like Testsigma, you can create test steps using simple language or use Java to test certain scenarios that might require coding.\n-   Set up the test environment and verify that everything is configured correctly.\n## Summary\nTest implementation is a critical stage in the software testing process. The implementation of tests early in the development process can help detect bugs early, which can save time and resources while improving overall quality.\nSo, just like how a well-organized kitchen sets the stage for a successful meal, proper test implementation sets the stage for a successful software release.\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n**How do you implement software testing?**\nTest implementation is the process of prioritizing and organizing tests. The implementation of software testing involves several steps, like planning the tests, designing test data, creating test cases, prioritizing the tests based on risks, finalizing the timeline for testing, test execution schedule, acquisition of testing tools, and so on.\n**What is the implementation and testing phase?**\nThe implementation and testing phase is a stage in the software development life cycle (SDLC) where the software testing plan is created, implemented, and executed. This helps ensure that the application meets the requirements and works as intended.\nNo-Code AI-Powered Testing\n![AI-Powered Testing](https://website-static.testsigma.com/blog/nextjs/10e8db/images/atto-home.webp?format=webp&w=256&q=75 \"AI-Powered Testing\")\n-   10X faster test development\n-   90% less maintenance with auto healing\n-   AI agents that power every phase of QA\n[Start Testing](https://testsigma.com/signup?utm_source=blog-side-bar-cta&utm_medium=side-bar-cta-blogs&utm_campaign=side-bar-cta-blogs)[Get a Demo](https://testsigma.com/request-demo?utm_source=blog-side-bar-cta&utm_medium=side-bar-cta-blogs&utm_campaign=side-bar-cta-blogs)\nPublished on: May 11, 2023\nRELATED BLOGS\n---\n[](https://testsigma.com/blog/test-automation-for-director-of-qa/)\n[\nThe Importance of Test Automation for Directors of QA\n](https://testsigma.com/blog/test-automation-for-director-of-qa/)\nTESTSIGMA ENGINEERING TEAM\n[TEST AUTOMATION](https://testsigma.com/blog/category/test-automation/)\n[](https://testsigma.com/blog/test-automation-for-sdet/)\n[\nWhy Automation Strategy Matters for SDETs\n](https://testsigma.com/blog/test-automation-for-sdet/)\nMEENAKSHI M\n[TEST AUTOMATION](https://testsigma.com/blog/category/test-automation/)\n[](https://testsigma.com/blog/what-is-test-case-prioritization/)\n[\nWhat is Test Case Prioritization in Software Testing\n](https://testsigma.com/blog/what-is-test-case-prioritization/)\nMEENAKSHI M\n[TEST AUTOMATION](https://testsigma.com/blog/category/test-automation/)",
