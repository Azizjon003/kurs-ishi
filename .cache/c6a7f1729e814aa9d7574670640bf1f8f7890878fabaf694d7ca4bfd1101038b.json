Created in the early 2000s to raise standards in the teaching and learning of literacy (and numeracy) at Key Stage 3, the National Strategies championed the co-teachability of reading and writing and stated in order for students to produce good quality writing, they need to have engaged in good quality reading and students should ‘demonstrate reading with a writer’s eye’ and ‘writing as a reader’ (DCSF 2009: 22). It is interesting that students were encouraged to engage with an interdisciplinary approach to English prior to GCSE and once more in A-level English Language and Literature. Whilst focusing on transactional, rather than creative writing, the NLS gave students a framework for writing that began with reading, the mindset being that if students had engaged with good quality examples of the type of writing that they were expected to demonstrate, they would be able to create a convincing text. This was not simply about getting students to, for example, write a letter, but to identify the accepted form and features of that text type and model their own writing around it. Students were encouraged to analyse examples at word, sentence and text level, in effect producing a stylistic analysis. This then led to framing writing, modelling, drafting and redrafting, but consistently reflecting on the exemplar material. Whilst presented as a model in the early 2000s for Key Stage 3, there can be little doubt that this forms a basis for the teaching of effective writing, regardless of Key Stage. When one considers the premise of transformative writing that is constructed for A-level, it is clear that this model can be replicated - a stylistic analysis to engage with form and tone to aid writing, followed by self-reflective commentary.\nStylistic analysis, as Carter and Stockwell (2008: 291) note, is an area of linguistic discipline with its validity and methodologies ‘sitting uncomfortably on the bridge between the linguistic and the literary’. Carter goes on to explain that stylistics can be viewed as ‘too soft’ (Carter and Stockwell 2008: 291) by linguists, yet ‘reductive’ (Carter and Stockwell 2008: 291) by those with a literature specialism. However, the interdisciplinary approach offered through language and literature study seems to provide the ‘bridge’ between the two schools of thought. A-level English Language and Literature provides students with ‘a single coherent discipline: in fact, that it is naturally the central discipline of literary study’ (Carter and Stockwell 2008: 292). For students of post-16, it also draws on their prior learning, so that the ‘bridge’ (Carter and Stock-well 2008: 291) between their former separate studies of GCSE English Language and GCSE English Literature becomes much more comfortable. Students often find the step from GCSE to A-level challenging with the depth and skills required being significantly more sophisticated. However, the English language and literature course offers students an opportunity to explore how they perceive the literary experience, represented in the form of stylistic choices made and the impact had on how these are received by students as readers and adapted in their transformative task as writers. The learning experience becomes more personal and begins by foregrounding how the students have engaged with the text as readers and developing their understandings through further analysis and working with the text itself in the form of the transformation writing. Up until GCSE study, students engaged in a very basic form of stylistic analysis - they identified relevant quotations (or data), but explore them for their literariness, explaining why they link to context, meaning and the effects on the reader. This evolved in their early post-16 studies where they explore with a greater depth of analysis, considering in more detail patterning, developing into stylistic analysis, which is fundamental to all aspects of language and literature study. Most aspects of post-16 English Language and Literature specifications require a truly interdisciplinary approach, where language study enriches understanding of literature, and the study of literature contributes to students’ understanding of language.\nIf it is accepted then that stylistic analysis, the deconstruction of a text to identify patterns to develop an understanding of a text, is a fundamental feature of language and literature study, then it should provide the basis for the demonstration of synoptic skills through the transformed voice. From my experience in the classroom, stylistic analysis has allowed students to understand that literature is crafted and structured, and that an author has consciously shaped and developed linguistic patterns for their texts and their constructed characters. However, stylistic analysis of a character has its limitations when asked to write transformatively. Students are asked to go beyond the analytical style of traditional literary criticism essays, where readers offer ‘a more passive reception of the text’ (Carter 2010: 62) and are essentially asked to use the stylistic patterning they identify for a character. Through stylistic analysis, students recognise the patterns within and across a text, for example identifying a character’s idiolect establishing what makes them unique as a speaker, but then drive this forward into their own transformation and commentary. In doing so, they fully engage with the study of English, as an interdisciplinary skill.\nDespite also referencing the limitations of stylistic analysis, Carter (2010: 57) notes this approach has ‘served to make explicit and retrievable how interpretation is formed, or new aspects of interpretation revealed’. Transformative writing fits neatly into this, as it is arguably, in presenting a text in an alternative form or from an alternative perspective, another example of literary interpretation, which allows students to become writers and analysts. Indeed, Carter (2010: 58) goes on to suggest that students need to be\nactive participants in, and explorers of, linguistic and cultural processes both with an awareness of and an interest in the process itself, including the development of a metalanguage for articulating responses to this.\nAlbeit more creatively rather than analytically, students are asked to engage with such a cycle when writing transformatively. When one considers the self-reflective commentary that students complete on their own writing, the cycle truly completes (Figure 7.1).\n![Cycle illustrating the self-reflective commentary process](https://ebrary.net/htm/img/16/3484/8.png)\n_Figure 7.1_ Cycle illustrating the self-reflective commentary process.",
