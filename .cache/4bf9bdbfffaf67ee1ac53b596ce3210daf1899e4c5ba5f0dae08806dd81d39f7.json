It highlights examples from two texts, examining how ellipsis reflects character mood and style, while noting its common usage in speech versus potential incoherence in writing. The analysis indicates a deliberate use of ellipsis by authors to engage readers and involves a unique style where character differentiation is less pronounced.\n[Education](https://www.slideshare.net/category/education)◦\nRead more\n1Save\nShare\nEmbed\n[1 / 17\n](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/ellipsis-in-stylistics/236202072#1)\n[2 / 17\n](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/ellipsis-in-stylistics/236202072#2)\n[3 / 17\n](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/ellipsis-in-stylistics/236202072#3)\n[4 / 17\n](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/ellipsis-in-stylistics/236202072#4)\n[5 / 17\nMost read\n](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/ellipsis-in-stylistics/236202072#5)\n[6 / 17\nMost read\n](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/ellipsis-in-stylistics/236202072#6)\n[7 / 17\n](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/ellipsis-in-stylistics/236202072#7)\n[8 / 17\n](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/ellipsis-in-stylistics/236202072#8)\n[9 / 17\n](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/ellipsis-in-stylistics/236202072#9)\n[10 / 17\nMost read\n](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/ellipsis-in-stylistics/236202072#10)\n[11 / 17\n](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/ellipsis-in-stylistics/236202072#11)\n[12 / 17\n](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/ellipsis-in-stylistics/236202072#12)\n[13 / 17\n](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/ellipsis-in-stylistics/236202072#13)\n[14 / 17\n](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/ellipsis-in-stylistics/236202072#14)\n[15 / 17\n](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/ellipsis-in-stylistics/236202072#15)\n[16 / 17\n](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/ellipsis-in-stylistics/236202072#16)\n[17 / 17\n](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/ellipsis-in-stylistics/236202072#17)\n![Topic: ELLIPSIS\nPresented By: Group 3\n](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/stylisticspresentationellipsis-200625112412/75/Ellipsis-in-Stylistics-1-2048.jpg)\n![Group\nMembers\n• Ghaza Ejaz\n• Fatima Bint e Mazhar\n• Zarmeen Umer\nWrite Up Done By\n• Zia Ur Rehman\n• Raiha Haider\nPresentation:\n](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/stylisticspresentationellipsis-200625112412/75/Ellipsis-in-Stylistics-2-2048.jpg)\n![Definition:\n Ellipses is a cohesive device involving the absence of an item which the reader or listener\nmust supply. The cohesive link is set up by the process of referring to recover the missing\nitem (as in pronominal reference):\nHow was Spain? I didn’t go ˍˍˍˍˍ\n(where “to Spain” is ellipted).\n Ellipses can also be used to set up coherent links.\n Ellipsis is common in speech as a device for economy, but it’s use in writing treads a fine\nline between economy and incoherence (where too little information undermines\nunderstanding).\n](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/stylisticspresentationellipsis-200625112412/75/Ellipsis-in-Stylistics-3-2048.jpg)\n![Sources of\nthe Absent\nWords or\nPhrases\nWhile there is a cohesive link, the\ninformation comes from actual\ntext or context of the text.\nHowever, a coherent link can also\nbe formed where the absent phrase\nor word resides in common sense\nor general knowledge.\n](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/stylisticspresentationellipsis-200625112412/75/Ellipsis-in-Stylistics-4-2048.jpg)\n![TASK:\nNote the ellipses in text 1 & 2.\nTo what extent are they a product\nof the type of language being\nrepresented, and to what extent do\nthey constitute a deliberate\nstylistic effort by the writer?\n](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/stylisticspresentationellipsis-200625112412/75/Ellipsis-in-Stylistics-5-2048.jpg)\n![TEXT 1 (The Analyzed Part)\n‘Sheila isn’t here,’ he said without waiting for Charles to say anything, and without\nany greeting.\n‘Do You Mind if I come in all the same? I have Come some distance,’ muttered Charles.\n‘There’s only Edith and me here,’ said Robert, as if warning Charles that by coming in he\nwas exposing himself to an unpleasant ordeal; which was true.\nWithout answering, Charles levered himself past Robert and went into the hall. Edith\ncame out of the kitchen and confronted him. ‘Sheila isn’t here,’ she said. ‘I Know,’ said\nCharles, speaking too quickly to be fully intelligible. ‘Robert told me about it. Do you\nmind if come in perhaps I could have a cup of tea? Or tell me when Sheila will be back, I\nwanted to see her if I could.’\nAttribution:\nText 2 John Wain, Hurry on Down, pp. 15˗ 16.\n](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/stylisticspresentationellipsis-200625112412/75/Ellipsis-in-Stylistics-6-2048.jpg)\n![Solution\n‘[Do you] Mind if I come in all the same? [I have] Come some distance,’ muttered\nCharles.\n‘[I] Know,’ said Charles, speaking too quickly to be fully intelligible.\n‘Robert told me [she wasn’t here].

Note that almost all of this ellipsis involves the\nomission of auxiliary verbs and subject pronouns ˗˗˗˗\nwhich suggests that it is rule˗ governed in some way.\nSubject pronouns and auxiliaries are deleted in spoken\nEnglish quite frequently, but this usage is particularly\nassociated with upper˗ middle˗ class spoken English. In\nthis text, it demonstrates both the hastiness of the character\nCharles, and also his disinclination to engage with Edith\nand Robert whilst he waits foe Sheila.\n](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/stylisticspresentationellipsis-200625112412/75/Ellipsis-in-Stylistics-8-2048.jpg)\n![TEXT 2\n‘I will ask you once more. It is the last time. Will you or will you not?’\n‘I will not. It is also the last time. It must be the last.’\n‘you will not give me your reasons?’\n‘I will give you one. You have too much. Your house and your land. Your parents and your sister.\nYour sister who is also your friend. Your work and your growing name. I like things to be on a\nmoderate scale. To have them in my hands and not be held by them.’\n‘this is not the only reason. There must be a deeper one.’\n‘There is. And it may be deep. I do not want to marry. I seldom say so, to be disbelieved.’\nYou don’t feel that marriage would mean a fuller life?\n‘I don’t want the things it would be full of. Light words are sometimes true.’\n‘Then there must be a change. I do want to marry. I want to have descendants. I want to hand down\nmy name. I could not keep up our relation under a wife’s eyes. It has escaped my parents.’\n‘your father I daresay. What about your mother?’\n‘I am not sure. It is hard to know.’\n‘it has not escaped her, or you would know. Silence has its use.’\n](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/stylisticspresentationellipsis-200625112412/75/Ellipsis-in-Stylistics-9-2048.jpg)\n![The speaker’s indifference to convention appeared in her clothes, her cottage, and her habit of looking\nfull at her companion and voicing her thought. She was a short, fair woman of about thirty, with a deep voice,\na strongly cut face, and calm eyes that were said to see more than other people’s, and sometimes did. Her\ncompanion was a large, dark man, with solid, shapely features, heavy, gentle, nervous hands, strong, sudden\nmovements and a look of smouldering force. He ignored convention in another way, and in one that was his\nown. A consciousness of being a known and regarded figured showed in his dress and his bearing, and was\nalmost disguised. The breach of family tradition involved in his leading a writer’s life in addition to a\nlandowner's, enhanced him in his own eyes and supported his conception of himself.\n‘well, this is a last occasion. It becomes one. It is what you choose.’\n‘And what you do. I think you will be happy. And I hope she will. That is where the question lies.’\n‘if I marry her, she should be. I will do my part.’\n‘it will be easier than hers. I wonder if you know it.’\n](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/stylisticspresentationellipsis-200625112412/75/Ellipsis-in-Stylistics-10-2048.jpg)\n![‘hers cannot be what yours would be. I am helpless there.’\n‘so am I. I am not fitted for ordinary domestic life.’\n‘so I must live with someone who is. And I shall not see the life as ordinary. None is so to me.’\n‘How do you see your own life? It is even less so to you?’\n‘it is as it is. As I am what I am. I know I am a man of full nature. I know I am built on a large scale.\nI am not afraid to say it.’\n‘it is true that most people would be. If I thought it of myself, I should. So you can’t know if I think\nit. But do you know anyone who thinks he is built on a small scale?’\n‘I know many people who are. It is part of their interest to me.’\n‘but not of their interest to themselves. Do they know on what scale they are?;\n‘I am to marry someone who is on a moderate one, and who knows it.’\n‘then I guess who it is. There is someone of whom it is true.

Amazingly, this\nis the opening of a novel (the main ellipsis are numbered):\n‘I will ask you (1) once more. It is the last time (2). Will you or will you not (3)?’\n1. Not recoverable from context for several lines: ‘to marry me’;\n2. ‘I will ask you’;\n3. Not recoverable for several lines: ‘marry me’;\n4. Not recoverable for several lines: ‘marry you’;\n5. ‘I will tell you’;\n6. ‘time’.\nNote that in this passage, as in John Wain, Hurry on Down, ellipsis is most frequent in\nspeech . Here though, two characters, rather than one are employing it, and the range\nof things ellipted is much wider.\n](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/stylisticspresentationellipsis-200625112412/75/Ellipsis-in-Stylistics-13-2048.jpg)\n![Verdict (Continued)\nEven though ellipsis is more common in actual speech than in writing, it is difficult to\nimagine a real conversation using it this much, and in this way. Conversation is usually\nmuch more wordy!\nThis highly ellipted style would seem to be a deliberate choice on the part of Compton˗\nBurnett˗˗˗˗ as will be confirmed by reading any of her other novels. The effect is to\ninvolve the reader as much as possible in creating the meaning of the text˗˗˗ hence the use\nof dialogue rather than omniscient narration, the high frequency of ellipsis, and even the\nhigher frequency of pronoun replacement˗˗˗˗ another feature of cohesion which relies on\nthe reader to supply the referent. Note the pronouns in this section:\n](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/stylisticspresentationellipsis-200625112412/75/Ellipsis-in-Stylistics-14-2048.jpg)\n![Verdict (Continued)\nwell, this is a last occasion. It becomes one. It is what you choose.’\n‘And what you do. I think you will be happy. And I hope she will. That is where the\nquestion lies.’\n‘if I marry her, she should be. I will do my part.’\n‘it will be easier than hers. I wonder if you know it.’\n‘hers cannot be what yours would be. I am helpless there.’\nParticularly the shifting reference of it. Some readers will find this style alienating, as it\nrequires considerable effort to read; whilst other readers will relish the logical,\nunflappable, pedantic trait of the speakers. One of the most unusual features of\nCompton˗ Burnett’s writing is that she does not attempt to differentiate between her\ncharacters in terms of their spoken styles. Usually, authors try to create caracters with\nidentifiable personalities through slight differences in their idiolects.\nIn Compton˗ Burnett’s writing, however, characterization is subordinated\n](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/stylisticspresentationellipsis-200625112412/75/Ellipsis-in-Stylistics-15-2048.jpg)\n![Verdict (Continued)\nto a fascination with logic; and, delightfully, all the characters speak in this\nway, from the lord and lady of the manor to the children and the servants.\nWhen considering the writing of Raymond Chandler, we remarked that this\ndistinctive stylistic trait was his terse handling of the verb phrase; Compton˗\nBurnett’s style lies in her manipulation of ellipsis.\n](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/stylisticspresentationellipsis-200625112412/75/Ellipsis-in-Stylistics-16-2048.jpg)\n![THANK YOU!\n](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/stylisticspresentationellipsis-200625112412/75/Ellipsis-in-Stylistics-17-2048.jpg)\n## Recommended\n[](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/syntax-231654089/231654089)\nPPTX\nSyntax\nby[Serpil Meri-Yilan](https://www.slideshare.net/SerpilMeriYilan)\n[](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/pragmatics-speech-acts/17052184)\nPPTX\nPragmatics (Speech Acts)\nby[RubyRose Baldovino](https://www.slideshare.net/RRbaldovino)\n[](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/systemic-functional-linguistics-textual-meanings/237945180)\nPPT\nSYSTEMIC FUNCTIONAL LINGUISTICS: TEXTUAL MEANINGS\nby[A.

The cohesive link is set up by the process of referring to recover the missing item (as in pronominal reference): How was Spain? I didn’t go ˍˍˍˍˍ (where “to Spain” is ellipted).  Ellipses can also be used to set up coherent links.  Ellipsis is common in speech as a device for economy, but it’s use in writing treads a fine line between economy and incoherence (where too little information undermines understanding).\n-   4.\n    [Sources of the Absent Words](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/ellipsis-in-stylistics/236202072#4)or Phrases While there is a cohesive link, the information comes from actual text or context of the text.

To what extent are they a product of the type of language being represented, and to what extent do they constitute a deliberate stylistic effort by the writer?\n-   6.\n    [TEXT 1 (The](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/ellipsis-in-stylistics/236202072#6)Analyzed Part) ‘Sheila isn’t here,’ he said without waiting for Charles to say anything, and without any greeting. ‘Do You Mind if I come in all the same? I have Come some distance,’ muttered Charles. ‘There’s only Edith and me here,’ said Robert, as if warning Charles that by coming in he was exposing himself to an unpleasant ordeal; which was true. Without answering, Charles levered himself past Robert and went into the hall. Edith came out of the kitchen and confronted him. ‘Sheila isn’t here,’ she said. ‘I Know,’ said Charles, speaking too quickly to be fully intelligible. ‘Robert told me about it. Do you mind if come in perhaps I could have a cup of tea? Or tell me when Sheila will be back, I wanted to see her if I could.’ Attribution: Text 2 John Wain, Hurry on Down, pp. 15˗ 16.\n-   7.\n    [Solution ‘\\[Do you\\] Mind](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/ellipsis-in-stylistics/236202072#7)if I come in all the same? \\[I have\\] Come some distance,’ muttered Charles. ‘\\[I\\] Know,’ said Charles, speaking too quickly to be fully intelligible. ‘Robert told me \\[she wasn’t here\\]. \\[Do you\\] mind if \\[I\\] come in perhaps \\[I could have a\\] cup of tea? Or \\[Could you tell me\\] when Sheila \\[will\\] be back \\[I\\] wanted to see her if I could.’\n-   8.\n    [Verdict The ellipses come](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/ellipsis-in-stylistics/236202072#8)here wholly within the speech of one character ˗˗˗˗˗ where it represents his perturbance and mood. Note that almost all of this ellipsis involves the omission of auxiliary verbs and subject pronouns ˗˗˗˗ which suggests that it is rule˗ governed in some way. Subject pronouns and auxiliaries are deleted in spoken English quite frequently, but this usage is particularly associated with upper˗ middle˗ class spoken English. In this text, it demonstrates both the hastiness of the character Charles, and also his disinclination to engage with Edith and Robert whilst he waits foe Sheila.\n-   9.\n    [TEXT 2 ‘I will](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/ellipsis-in-stylistics/236202072#9)ask you once more. It is the last time. Will you or will you not?’ ‘I will not. It is also the last time. It must be the last.’ ‘you will not give me your reasons?’ ‘I will give you one. You have too much. Your house and your land. Your parents and your sister. Your sister who is also your friend. Your work and your growing name. I like things to be on a moderate scale. To have them in my hands and not be held by them.’ ‘this is not the only reason. There must be a deeper one.’ ‘There is. And it may be deep. I do not want to marry. I seldom say so, to be disbelieved.’ You don’t feel that marriage would mean a fuller life? ‘I don’t want the things it would be full of. Light words are sometimes true.’ ‘Then there must be a change. I do want to marry. I want to have descendants. I want to hand down my name. I could not keep up our relation under a wife’s eyes. It has escaped my parents.’ ‘your father I daresay. What about your mother?’ ‘I am not sure. It is hard to know.’ ‘it has not escaped her, or you would know. Silence has its use.’\n-   10.\n    [The speaker’s indifference](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/ellipsis-in-stylistics/236202072#10)to convention appeared in her clothes, her cottage, and her habit of looking full at her companion and voicing her thought. She was a short, fair woman of about thirty, with a deep voice, a strongly cut face, and calm eyes that were said to see more than other people’s, and sometimes did. Her companion was a large, dark man, with solid, shapely features, heavy, gentle, nervous hands, strong, sudden movements and a look of smouldering force. He ignored convention in another way, and in one that was his own. A consciousness of being a known and regarded figured showed in his dress and his bearing, and was almost disguised. The breach of family tradition involved in his leading a writer’s life in addition to a landowner's, enhanced him in his own eyes and supported his conception of himself. ‘well, this is a last occasion. It becomes one. It is what you choose.’ ‘And what you do. I think you will be happy. And I hope she will. That is where the question lies.’ ‘if I marry her, she should be. I will do my part.’ ‘it will be easier than hers. I wonder if you know it.’\n-   11.\n    [‘hers cannot be](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/ellipsis-in-stylistics/236202072#11)what yours would be. I am helpless there.’ ‘so am I. I am not fitted for ordinary domestic life.’ ‘so I must live with someone who is. And I shall not see the life as ordinary. None is so to me.’ ‘How do you see your own life? It is even less so to you?’ ‘it is as it is. As I am what I am. I know I am a man of full nature. I know I am built on a large scale. I am not afraid to say it.’ ‘it is true that most people would be. If I thought it of myself, I should. So you can’t know if I think it. But do you know anyone who thinks he is built on a small scale?’ ‘I know many people who are. It is part of their interest to me.’ ‘but not of their interest to themselves. Do they know on what scale they are?; ‘I am to marry someone who is on a moderate one, and who knows it.’ ‘then I guess who it is. There is someone of whom it is true. And there would not be anyone else.’ ‘my father perhaps?’ ‘But you can hardly marry him, Hereward.’ Attribution: Ivy Compton˗ Burnett, A God and His Gifts, pp. 5˗7\n-   12.\n    [Solution • I will](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/ellipsis-in-stylistics/236202072#12)only mention a few random here. Will you \\[marry\\] or will you not \\[marry\\]. I will not \\[marry\\]. There is \\[another reason\\].’ \\[It has escaped\\] your father I daresay. ‘If I marry her, she should be \\[happy\\]\n-   13.\n    [Verdict There are so](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/ellipsis-in-stylistics/236202072#13)much ellipsis in this passage that it borders on the incoherent. Amazingly, this is the opening of a novel (the main ellipsis are numbered): ‘I will ask you (1) once more. It is the last time (2). Will you or will you not (3)?’ 1. Not recoverable from context for several lines: ‘to marry me’; 2. ‘I will ask you’; 3. Not recoverable for several lines: ‘marry me’; 4. Not recoverable for several lines: ‘marry you’; 5. ‘I will tell you’; 6. ‘time’. Note that in this passage, as in John Wain, Hurry on Down, ellipsis is most frequent in speech . Here though, two characters, rather than one are employing it, and the range of things ellipted is much wider.\n-   14.\n    [Verdict (Continued) Even though](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/ellipsis-in-stylistics/236202072#14)ellipsis is more common in actual speech than in writing, it is difficult to imagine a real conversation using it this much, and in this way. Conversation is usually much more wordy! This highly ellipted style would seem to be a deliberate choice on the part of Compton˗ Burnett˗˗˗˗ as will be confirmed by reading any of her other novels. The effect is to involve the reader as much as possible in creating the meaning of the text˗˗˗ hence the use of dialogue rather than omniscient narration, the high frequency of ellipsis, and even the higher frequency of pronoun replacement˗˗˗˗ another feature of cohesion which relies on the reader to supply the referent. Note the pronouns in this section:\n-   15.\n    [Verdict (Continued) well, this](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/ellipsis-in-stylistics/236202072#15)is a last occasion. It becomes one. It is what you choose.’ ‘And what you do. I think you will be happy. And I hope she will. That is where the question lies.’ ‘if I marry her, she should be. I will do my part.’ ‘it will be easier than hers. I wonder if you know it.’ ‘hers cannot be what yours would be. I am helpless there.’ Particularly the shifting reference of it. Some readers will find this style alienating, as it requires considerable effort to read; whilst other readers will relish the logical, unflappable, pedantic trait of the speakers. One of the most unusual features of Compton˗ Burnett’s writing is that she does not attempt to differentiate between her characters in terms of their spoken styles. Usually, authors try to create caracters with identifiable personalities through slight differences in their idiolects. In Compton˗ Burnett’s writing, however, characterization is subordinated\n-   16.\n    [Verdict (Continued) to a](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/ellipsis-in-stylistics/236202072#16)fascination with logic; and, delightfully, all the characters speak in this way, from the lord and lady of the manor to the children and the servants. When considering the writing of Raymond Chandler, we remarked that this distinctive stylistic trait was his terse handling of the verb phrase; Compton˗ Burnett’s style lies in her manipulation of ellipsis.\n-   17.\n    [THANK YOU!](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/ellipsis-in-stylistics/236202072#17)\n[About](https://en.scribd.com/about)[Support](https://support.scribd.com/hc/en-us/articles/210135446-Our-support-team)[Terms](https://support.scribd.com/hc/en-us/sections/202246126-Terms-and-Policies)[Privacy](https://support.scribd.com/hc/en-us/articles/210129366-Global-Privacy-Policy)[Copyright](https://support.scribd.com/hc/en-us/sections/202246086)[Cookie Preferences](#)[Do not sell or share my personal information](https://support.scribd.com/hc/en-us/articles/360038016931-Privacy-Rights-Request-Form)\nEnglish\n© 2025 Slideshare from Scribd\n[](https://www.instagram.com/slideshare_official \"Instagram\")[](https://www.facebook.com/slideshareofficial \"Facebook\")[](https://www.linkedin.com/company/slideshare \"LinkedIn\")[](https://www.slideshare.net/rss/latest \"RSS\")",
