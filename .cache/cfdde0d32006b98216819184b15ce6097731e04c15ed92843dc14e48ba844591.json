A network with few layers cannot handle tasks like image or speech recognition.\n-   **Efficiency**\nThe neural network’s architecture affects the efficiency of the model. For instance, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have lower computational costs compared to fully connected networks.\n-   **Optimization**\nThe network’s structure affects its optimization. For instance, deeper networks may face issues like vanishing gradients, where the gradients become too small for effective learning in early layers.\n-   **Task-specific design**\nThe architecture of networks can be tailored to specific tasks, such as CNNs for [image classification](https://www.upgrad.com/blog/image-classification-in-cnn/) and RNNs for sequence prediction.\nLet’s explore the ANN architecture briefly before moving ahead with neural networks.\n### **What is ANN Architecture and Its Role in Neural Networks?**\nThe Artificial Neural Network (ANN) architecture refers to the structured arrangement of nodes (neurons) and layers that define how an artificial neural network processes and learns from data. The design of ANN influences its ability to learn complex patterns and perform tasks efficiently.\nHere’s the role of ANN architecture in neural networks.\n-   **Task-specific design**\nThe architecture is chosen based on the task and the type of data. For example, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are suitable for image data, while Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or transformers are preferred for sequential functions like speech and text analysis. CNNs, in particular, leverage convolutional layers to detect spatial hierarchies in images, making the [architecture of CNN](https://www.upgrad.com/blog/basic-cnn-architecture/) an essential factor in tasks like image classification.\n-   **Capacity to learn complex patterns**\nA network's depth (number of hidden layers) and width (number of neurons per layer) affect its capacity to capture complex relationships in the data. Deep architectures are effective for complex tasks like image recognition and speech processing.\n-   **Efficiency**\nThe architecture affects the computational efficiency of the network. For example, CNNs use of shared weights in convolutional layers reduces the number of parameters and computational cost.\n-   **Optimization**\nThe structure of the architecture impacts the effectiveness of the network. For instance, deeper networks face challenges like the vanishing gradient problem.\n-   **Model generalization**\nThe architecture influences the model's ability to generalize to unseen data. Complex architectures with too many parameters can lead to overfitting, while simpler architectures may not capture enough data complexity.\nAfter a brief overview, let’s explore the different types of neural network architectures.\n## **What Are the Different Types of Neural Network Architectures?**\nA neural network consists of several key components that work together to process and learn from data—the way these components are structured influences the network's learning and processing capabilities.\nHere are the fundamental components of a neural network architecture.\n-   **Input layer**\nThe input layer is where data enters the system. Each neuron corresponds to a feature in the input dataset. It passes raw inputs (such as pixel values in an image) to the next layers for further processing.\n-   **Hidden layers**\nThe hidden layers are present between the input and output layers and are where the actual learning and computation happen. Hidden layers transform the input data, allowing the network to learn complex patterns and abstract representations. The more hidden layers, the more complicated patterns it can learn.\n-   **Neurons (nodes)**\nNeurons (or nodes) are the basic units of computation in a neural network. Each neuron takes inputs, applies a weighted sum, adds a bias, and passes the output through an activation function. The number of neurons and their arrangement in layers affects the network's ability to learn complex patterns.\n-   **Weights and biases**\nWeights are the parameters that control the strength of the connections between neurons, while biases are additional parameters that allow the network to shift the activation function. The network adjusts weights and biases during training to minimize the mistakes between predicted and actual outputs.\n-   **Activation functions**\nAn activation function is applied to the output of each neuron in the hidden and output layers. Common activation functions include Sigmoid, ReLU, and Tanh. Activation functions enable a network to learn complex relationships between inputs and outputs.\n-   **Output layer**\nThe output layer is responsible for producing the network's predictions or classifications based on the transformed data from the hidden layers. The output layer maps the learned features, such as class labels in classification tasks, from the hidden layers to the final output.\n-   **Loss Function**\nThe loss function (or cost function) measures the distance of the network's predictions from the actual target values. Common loss functions include mean squared error (for regression) and cross-entropy (for classification). The loss function is critical for training, as it guides the optimization process.\n**Also Read:** [**Top 10 Neural Network Architectures in 2024 ML Engineers Need to Learn**](https://www.upgrad.com/blog/neural-network-architectures/)\nNow that you understand the fundamental building blocks of neural networks, let's explore how you can use them in real-world applications.\n## **What Are The Applications Of Neural Networks?**\nNeural networks have revolutionized the way industries function by allowing systems to learn from data, adapt, and make decisions with human-like intelligence.\nHere are some key applications across different sectors, highlighting how neural networks can contribute to solving complex problems and advancing technology.\n**1\\.

The choice of algorithm depends on factors such as the type of data and the desired level of accuracy.\nHere are the broad classifications of algorithms used in neural networks.\n### **Supervised Learning Algorithms in Neural Networks**\nSupervised learning involves training neural networks with labeled data, where the model learns to map inputs to known outputs. The training data for the model includes both input features and corresponding output labels.\nHere are some fundamental algorithms used in supervised learning.\n**1\\. Backpropagation**\nBackpropagation calculates the gradient of the loss function with respect to each weight by using the chain rule and then adjusting the weights to minimize the error.\nThe algorithm enables the network to \"learn\" from the data, thus improving model accuracy by iteratively modifying the weights based on the error gradients.\n**2.** [**Gradient descent**](https://www.upgrad.com/blog/gradient-descent-in-machine-learning/)\nGradient descent is an optimization algorithm that reduces the cost (loss) function by adjusting the model parameters (weights). The algorithm moves in the direction of the steepest decrease in the loss function. The model can train the neural networks by minimizing the loss function, enabling the model to improve over time.\n**3\\. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)**\nStochastic Gradient Descent is a type of gradient descent where the model parameters are updated after each training rather than after processing the entire dataset. Variants like Momentum SGD help improve the efficiency of training, making it faster and more suitable for handling large datasets.\n**Also Read:** [**Supervised Vs. Unsupervised Learning**](https://www.upgrad.com/blog/supervised-vs-unsupervised-learning/)\n### **Unsupervised Learning Algorithms in Neural Networks**\n[Unsupervised learning algorithms](https://www.upgrad.com/blog/everything-you-should-know-about-unsupervised-learning-algorithms/) function without labeled data, aiming to discover hidden patterns and features within the data. Here are the major unsupervised learning algorithms used in neural networks.\n**1\\. Autoencoders**\nAutoencoders are neural networks used for unsupervised learning tasks, especially for data compression and feature extraction. They have an encoder that compresses the input data and a decoder that reconstructs the input.\nAutoencoders can focus on relevant features, making them suitable for tasks like anomaly detection and dimensionality reduction.\n**2\\. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**\nGANs consist of two neural networks—the generator and the discriminator—competing against each other. The generator creates artificial data while the discriminator evaluates them, providing feedback to improve the generator's output.\nGANs can generate new data instances, such as realistic images or video frames, based on the patterns learned from the input data.\n### **Reinforcement Learning Algorithms for Neural Networks**\nReinforcement learning (RL) algorithms enable the system to make decisions by interacting with an environment and obtaining rewards or penalties based on their actions.\nHere are some examples of Reinforcement Learning algorithms.\n**1.** [**Q-Learning**](https://www.upgrad.com/blog/q-learning-in-python-with-examples/)\nIn Q-learning, the system agent learns an outline of steps to take to maximize cumulative reward over time. It does so by learning the value of each action in each state. Q-learning will help the system figure out the best action to take in any given state based on the rewards received after each action.\n**2\\. Policy Gradient methods**\nPolicy gradient methods directly optimize the policy, as opposed to value-based methods like Q-learning. These methods use gradients to adjust the policy parameters to maximize expected rewards. They are particularly useful in environments with large or continuous action spaces.\n### **The Role of Optimization Algorithms in Neural Networks**\nOptimization algorithms help fine-tune neural network models, ensuring that they perform efficiently and generalize well on unseen data.\nHere are some of the common optimization algorithms in neural networks.\n**1\\. Adam Optimizer**\nAdam (Adaptive Moment Estimation) algorithm combines the benefits of both RMSprop and Momentum. It adapts the learning rate for each parameter by using both the first moment (mean) and second moment (variance) of the gradients.\nAdam is used mainly for its ability to adjust the learning rate during training, especially in complex deep-learning models.\n**2\\. RMSprop**\nRMSprop (Root Mean Square Propagation) adjusts the learning rate based on recent gradients, effectively negating the vanishing learning rate problem often encountered in Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).\nRMSprop helps to prevent the learning rate from becoming too small, especially for tasks involving sequential data like natural language processing.\n**Also Read:** [**How Deep Learning Algorithms are Transforming our Lives?**](https://www.upgrad.com/blog/how-deep-learning-algorithms-are-transforming-our-everyday-lives/)\nNow that we've covered the fundamental algorithms let's explore how neural networks learn from data.\n## **How Do Neural Networks Learn from Data?**\nNeural networks can recognize patterns, make predictions, and adjust their internal parameters to improve performance. The model trains on a labeled dataset and updates its weights to minimize the error in its predictions.\nHere’s how neural networks can learn from data.\n### **What Steps Are Involved in the Learning Process of Neural Networks?**\nLet's break down the learning process of neural networks into the following steps.\n**1\\. Forward propagation**\nThe input data in forward propagation is passed through the network, layer by layer, to generate an output.  Each neuron performs a calculation by applying weights and biases to the input data, followed by an activation function.\nThe goal is to compute the predicted output of the neural network and compare it with the true output.\n**2\\. Loss Calculation**\nIn the next step, the predicted output is compared to the actual output to calculate the loss or error. The loss function calculates how far the model's prediction is from the true value. The main objective is to improve the model’s performance by minimizing losses.\n**3\\. Backpropagation**\nBackpropagation calculates the gradient of the loss function with respect to each weight in the network by applying the chain rule. It helps to decide how much each weight should be adjusted to reduce the error.\nThe purpose of this step is to update the weights in a way that reduces the overall loss.\n**4\\. Optimization Techniques**\nOptimization algorithms can adjust the weights more efficiently to reduce errors.\nStochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Adam are the two most commonly used optimization methods. The goal is to reduce error in such a way that the model generalizes unseen data well.\n**Also Read:** [**7 Most Used Machine Learning Algorithms in Python You Should Know About**](https://www.upgrad.com/blog/most-used-machine-learning-algorithms-in-python/)\nNow that we've explored the core algorithms powering neural networks, let's look into the practical steps of implementing neural networks using Python.\n## **How Can You Implement Neural Networks Using Python?**\nPython provides a rich ecosystem of frameworks and libraries for implementing neural networks.
