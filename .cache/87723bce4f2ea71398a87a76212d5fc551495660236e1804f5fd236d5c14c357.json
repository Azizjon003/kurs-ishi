Definition, Usage, and Literary Examples\n## Ellipsis Definition\nAn _ellipsis_ (uh-LIP-suhs) is an omission of words or events that allows readers to fill the gaps in the [sentence](https://www.supersummary.com/sentence/) or [narrative](https://www.supersummary.com/narrative/). The word _ellipsis_ comes from the Greek _élleipsis_, meaning “to leave out” or “fall short.”\n## Types of Ellipses\nThere are two primary categories of ellipses: marked and unmarked.\n**Marked Ellipses**\nA marked ellipsis is shown by the use of three periods in succession (…), sometimes with spaces around or in between the periods depending on the style writers prefer.\nMarked ellipses generally indicate a pause or a trailing thought, and literary writers use this punctuation in dialogue to imitate how people speak. An example would be “I was hoping…we could be more than friends.” Here, the punctuation indicates hesitance as the speaker asks a question they aren’t sure will receive the desired response.\nAn unfinished thought, on the other hand, may look as follows: “How is my brother doing after the accident, doctor? Is he conscious yet, or is he…?” In this example, the unfinished thought omits but implies the possibility that the speaker’s brother may be unconscious or worse.\n**Unmarked Ellipses**\nAn unmarked ellipsis omits without using any indicative punctuation. Consider the following examples:\n-   “I bought the shoes, and Noor the dress.” In this sentence, the word _bought_ is omitted.\n-   “Alex bought the shoes, not the dress.” The phrase _she didn’t buy_ is omitted from this example—replaced simply with _not_—though it’s clear to the reader that Alex didn’t purchase a dress while shopping.\n-   “Yuri brought three pencils for the test, and Ricardo brought two.” In this example, _pencils for the test_ is excluded from the second clause, as [context](https://www.supersummary.com/context/) clues imply this fact.\n-   “Hey Jamie, when does class start?” “At three.” In this instance, Jamie doesn’t say _The test starts_ because it’s clear what he’s addressing in his response.\n## Why Writers Use Ellipses\nWriters use ellipses to mirror the way people actually speak, imitating halting or trailing speech; advance the storyline by leaving out events or literary elements of the narrative; and convey emotion in a relatable way. Overall, when properly used, ellipses provide realistic details, emotional effects, and/or a sense that the author trusts the reader to fill in what was left out.\n**The Iceberg Theory**\nThe trust writers place in readers can be best exemplified by the iceberg theory. Pioneered by American writer Ernest Hemingway, the iceberg theory is a writing technique that emphasizes minimalism, focusing solely on the [narrative](https://www.supersummary.com/narrative/) rather than the theme behind the story. Hemingway was originally a journalist, so he took that field’s focus on facts and incorporated the philosophy into his literary works. He trusted that a reader could understand a story’s underlying theme without needing him to explicitly state it.\n## Ellipses in Film and TV\nNarrative ellipses are also prevalent in movies and TV, most often shown through a time jump.\nThe opening to Stanley Kubrick’s film _2001: A Space Odyssey_ transitions from the bone as a primitive tool to the futuristic space station and spacecraft. This implies the astronomical evolution of technology over the period of humanity’s existence. Another example is in TV series such as _Parks and Recreation_, where the penultimate season finale ends with a three-year jump into the future.\nChronological jumps can be present in subtler ways. There’s an implied time jump in most of the _Harry Potter_ films, as they barely showing the summers that pass between the school years. These jumps are designed so the viewer barely registers them and instead focuses on the important parts of the narrative instead. Regardless of how subtle or evident these ellipses appear, the primary function of this device is to further the storyline along.\n## Examples of Ellipses in Literature\n**1\\. James Joyce, “The Sisters” from** [**_Dubliners_**](https://www.supersummary.com/dubliners/summary/)\nIn this excerpt, Father Flynn has just died of a stroke. The protagonist’s aunt and one of the priest’s sisters, Eliza, are discussing his death during the wake.\nMy aunt waited until Eliza sighed and then said:\n> “Ah, well, he’s gone to a better world.”\n> Eliza sighed again and bowed her head in assent. My aunt fingered the stem of her wine-glass before sipping a little.\n> **“Did he…peacefully?”** she asked.\n> “Oh, quite peacefully, ma’am,” said Eliza. “You couldn’t tell when the breath went out of him. He had a beautiful death, God be praised.” \\[bolded for emphasis\\]\nOut of respect toward the deceased priest and his family, the protagonist’s aunt trails off, omitting the word _die_ from her question. Eliza understands her meaning and responds reassuringly.\n**2\\. F. Scott Fitzgerald,** [**_The Great Gatsby_**](https://www.supersummary.com/the-great-gatsby/summary/)\nThis passage is an example of how ellipses are used in modern literature. In this scene, narrator Nick Carraway leaves a party with Mr. McKee, who invites him to lunch:\n> “Come to lunch someday,” he suggested, as we groaned down in the elevator.\n> “Where?”\n> “Anywhere.”\n> “Keep your hands off the lever,” snapped the elevator boy.\n> “I beg your pardon,” said Mr. McKee with dignity, “I didn’t know I was touching it.”\n> “All right,” I agreed, “I’ll be glad to.”\n> . . . I was standing beside his bed and he was sitting up between the sheets, clad in his underwear, with a great portfolio in his hands.\nInstead of following this conversation with a lunch scene, Fitzgerald uses the ellipsis to omit what happened between the two men after leaving the party. The untold events are left to the reader to imagine, though many have seen the omission as implying a sexual relationship.\n**3\\. Langston Hughes, “Dream Variations”**\nHughes’s [poem](https://www.supersummary.com/poem/) imagines a life without racial discrimination. The ending concludes his fantasies in a trailing fashion as a result of ellipses:\n> Rest at pale evening . . .\n> A tall, slim tree . . .\n> Night coming tenderly\n> Black like me.\nThe effect of this device is a wistful, dreamlike effect as the poem concludes.\n## Further Resources on Ellipses\nAnne Toner provides an in-depth study of ellipses in literature in [_Ellipsis in English Literature_](https://books.google.com.pr/books?id=nKiwBgAAQBAJ&dq=ellipsis+writing&source=gbs_navlinks_s).\nShalom Lappin and Elabbas Benmamoun delve deeper into the topic of ellipses, providing a theoretical perspective in their study [_Fragments: Studies in Ellipsis and Gapping_](https://books.google.com.pr/books?id=QmVcON2pSS8C&dq=ellipsis&source=gbs_navlinks_s).\n## Related Terms\n-   Iceberg Theory\n-   [Narrative](https://www.supersummary.com/narrative/)\n-   [Sentence](https://www.supersummary.com/sentence/)\n-   Suspension Points\n[\n![Money-Back Guarantee icon](https://www.supersummary.com/icon_moneyback_guarantee.svg)\n7\\-day Money-Back Guarantee\n](https://help.supersummary.com/support/solutions/articles/64000259739-how-does-the-money-back-guarantee-work-)\n[![Powered by Braintree](https://www.supersummary.com/_next/image/?url=%2Fbadge_braintree.png&w=640&q=100)](https://www.braintreegateway.com/merchants/5qgr6b2xrr5j2szc/verified)\n---\n[](https://www.supersummary.com/ \"Go to homepage\")\n[![Download on the App Store](https://www.supersummary.com/badge-apple-app-store.svg)](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id6470153387?pt=123693347&ct=website-footer&mt=8)\n[![Get it on Google Play](https://www.supersummary.com/badge-google-play-store.svg)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.supersummary&referrer=utm_source%3Dwebsite%26utm_campaign%3Dwebsite-footer)\n---\ncompany\n[\nAbout Us\n](https://www.supersummary.com/about-us/)\n[\nOur Literary Experts\n](https://www.supersummary.com/our-literary-experts/)\n[\nWall of Love\n](https://www.supersummary.com/testimonials/)\n[\nWork With Us\n](https://www.supersummary.com/work-with-us/)\nlibrary\n[\nStudy Guides\n](https://www.supersummary.com/all-study-guides/A/)\n[\nTeaching Guides\n](https://www.supersummary.com/all-teaching-guides/A/)\n[\nPlot Summaries\n](https://www.supersummary.com/plot-summaries/A/)\n[\nStudy Guide Collections\n](https://www.supersummary.com/collections/)\n[\nNew This Week\n](https://www.supersummary.com/new-titles/)\n[\nBook Briefs\n](https://www.supersummary.com/all-book-briefs/A/)\nresources\n[\nLiterary Devices\n](https://www.supersummary.com/literary-devices/)\n[\nResource Guides\n](https://www.supersummary.com/resources/)\n[\nDiscussion Questions Tool\n](https://www.supersummary.com/tools/discussion-questions/)\nreaders\n[\nStudent\n](https://www.supersummary.com/subscribe/?audience=student)\n[\nTeacher\n](https://www.supersummary.com/subscribe/?audience=teacher)\n[\nBook Club Member\n](https://www.supersummary.com/subscribe/?audience=book_club_member)\n[\nParent\n](https://www.supersummary.com/subscribe/?audience=parent_of_student)\ncontact\n[\nHelp\n](https://help.supersummary.com/support/home)\n[\nFeedback\n](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfjvYkYSS657RwDtN9Vgckgf8N7cMkxut8gSegqYXcM_SnQMQ/viewform)\nSuggest a Title\n---\nCopyright ® 2025 SuperSummary/All Rights Reserved\n[Privacy Policy](https://www.supersummary.com/privacy-policy/)\n|\n[Terms of Service](https://www.supersummary.com/terms/)\n[](https://twitter.com/SuperSummary)[](https://www.facebook.com/supersummary/)[](https://www.instagram.com/supersummary/)",
