It discusses the types of limitations, their significance, and provides guidelines for writing about them, highlighting their role in advancing scholarly research.\nUpdated on August 24, 2023\n![a group of researchers writing their limitation of their study](https://images.prismic.io/aje-cms-production/9a84b301-ffae-41b1-8482-49b994ca749e_How-to-Write-Limitations-of-the-Study-%28with-examples%29.jpg?auto=compress,format&w=60)\nNo matter how well thought out, every research endeavor encounters challenges. There is simply no way to predict all possible variances throughout the process.\nThese uncharted boundaries and abrupt constraints are known as **limitations in research**. Identifying and acknowledging limitations is crucial for conducting rigorous studies. Limitations provide context and shed light on gaps in the prevailing inquiry and literature.\nThis article explores the importance of recognizing limitations and discusses how to write them effectively. By interpreting limitations in research and considering prevalent examples, we aim to reframe the perception from shameful mistakes to respectable revelations.\n## What are limitations in research?\nIn the clearest terms, research limitations are **the practical or theoretical shortcomings of a study that are often outside of the researcher’s control**. While these weaknesses limit the generalizability of a study’s conclusions, they also present a foundation for future research.\nSometimes limitations arise from tangible circumstances like time and funding constraints, or equipment and participant availability. Other times the rationale is more obscure and buried within the research design. Common [types of limitations](https://www.linkedin.com/advice/3/what-best-practices-writing-research-limitations-skills-research) and their ramifications include:\n-   Theoretical: limits the scope, depth, or applicability of a study.\n-   Methodological: limits the quality, quantity, or diversity of the data.\n-   Empirical: limits the representativeness, validity, or reliability of the data.\n-   Analytical: limits the accuracy, completeness, or significance of the findings.\n-   Ethical: limits the access, consent, or confidentiality of the data.\nRegardless of how, when, or why they arise, **limitations are a natural part of the research process and should never be ignored**. Like all other aspects, they are vital in their own purpose.\n## Why is identifying limitations important?\nWhether to seek acceptance or avoid struggle, humans often instinctively hide flaws and mistakes. Merging this thought process into research by attempting to hide limitations, however, is a bad idea. It has the potential to negate the validity of outcomes and damage the reputation of scholars.\nBy identifying and addressing limitations throughout a project, researchers strengthen their arguments and curtail the chance of peer censure based on overlooked mistakes. Pointing out these flaws shows an understanding of variable limits and a scrupulous research process.\nShowing awareness of and taking responsibility for a project’s boundaries and challenges validates the integrity and transparency of a researcher. It further demonstrates the researchers understand the applicable literature and have thoroughly evaluated their chosen research methods.\nPresenting limitations also benefits the readers by providing context for research findings. It guides them to interpret the project’s conclusions only within the scope of very specific conditions. By allowing for an appropriate generalization of the findings that is accurately confined by research boundaries and is not too broad, **limitations boost a study’s credibility**.\nLimitations are true assets to the research process. They highlight opportunities for future research. When researchers identify the limitations of their particular approach to a study question, they enable precise transferability and improve chances for reproducibility.\nSimply stating a project’s limitations is not adequate for spurring further research, though. To spark the interest of other researchers, these acknowledgements must come with thorough explanations regarding how the limitations affected the current study and how they can potentially be overcome with amended methods.\n## How to write limitations\nTypically, the information about a study’s limitations is situated either at the beginning of the discussion section to provide context for readers or at the conclusion of [the discussion section](https://www.aje.com/arc/how-to-write-the-discussion-section/) to acknowledge the need for further research. However, it varies depending upon the target journal or publication guidelines.\n### Don’t hide your limitations\nIt is also important to not bury a limitation in the body of the paper unless it has a unique connection to a topic in that section. If so, it needs to be reiterated with the other limitations or at the conclusion of the discussion section. Wherever it is included in the manuscript, ensure that the limitations section is prominently positioned and clearly introduced.\nWhile maintaining transparency by disclosing limitations means taking a comprehensive approach, it is not necessary to discuss everything that could have potentially gone wrong during the research study. If there is no commitment to investigation in the introduction, it is unnecessary to consider the issue a limitation to the research. Wholly consider the term ‘limitations’ and ask, “Did it significantly change or limit the possible outcomes?” Then, qualify the occurrence as either a limitation to include in the current manuscript or as an idea to note for other projects.\n### Writing limitations\nOnce the limitations are concretely identified and it is decided where they will be included in the paper, researchers are ready for the writing task. Including only what is pertinent, keeping explanations detailed but concise, and employing the following guidelines is key for crafting valuable limitations:\n1) **Identify and describe the limitations**: Clearly introduce the limitation by classifying its form and specifying its origin. For example:\n-   An unintentional bias encountered during data collection\n-   An intentional use of unplanned post-hoc data analysis\n2) **Explain the implications**: Describe how the limitation potentially influences the study’s findings and how the validity and generalizability are subsequently impacted. Provide examples and evidence to support claims of the limitations’ effects without making excuses or exaggerating their impact. Overall, be transparent and objective in presenting the limitations, without undermining the significance of the research.\n3) **Provide alternative approaches for future studies**: Offer specific suggestions for potential improvements or avenues for further investigation. Demonstrate a proactive approach by encouraging future research that addresses the identified gaps and, therefore, expands the knowledge base.\nWhether presenting limitations as an individual section within the manuscript or as a subtopic in the discussion area, authors should use clear headings and straightforward language to facilitate readability. There is no need to complicate limitations with jargon, computations, or complex datasets.\n## Examples of common limitations\nLimitations are generally grouped into [two categories](https://libguides.usc.edu/writingguide/limitations), **methodology** and **research process**.\n### Methodology limitations\nMethodology may include limitations due to:\n-   Sample size\n-   Lack of available or reliable data\n-   Lack of prior research studies on the topic\n-   Measure used to collect the data\n-   Self-reported data\n![methodology limitation example](https://images.prismic.io/aje-cms-production/91bbe2a8-e7e7-458b-bfda-ef28a4f68d85_methodology+limitations+example.png?auto=compress,format&w=60)\nThe researcher is addressing how the large sample size requires a reassessment of the measures used to collect and analyze the data.\n### Research process limitations\nLimitations during the research process may arise from:\n-   Access to information\n-   Longitudinal effects\n-   Cultural and other biases\n-   Language fluency\n-   Time constraints\n![research process limitations example](https://images.prismic.io/aje-cms-production/f0d7f13f-67f0-4576-b112-202f0cc67d33_research+process+limitations+example.png?auto=compress,format&w=60)\nThe author is pointing out that the model’s estimates are based on potentially biased observational studies.\n## Final thoughts\nSuccessfully proving theories and touting great achievements are only two very narrow goals of scholarly research. The true passion and greatest efforts of researchers comes more in the form of confronting assumptions and exploring the obscure.\nIn many ways, recognizing and sharing the limitations of a research study both allows for and encourages this type of discovery that continuously pushes research forward. By using limitations to provide a transparent account of the project's boundaries and to contextualize the findings, researchers pave the way for even more robust and impactful research in the future.\nContributors\n[\n![Charla Viera, MS, Library and Information Science Texas Woman's University](https://aje-cms-production.cdn.prismic.io/aje-cms-production/2ac83ec6-d356-40ac-ba29-bb2e5b419f91_Charla_Viera_cropped.svg)\nCharla Viera, MS\nAJE Author\n](https://www.aje.com/authors/charla-viera)\nTag\n[](https://www.aje.com/arc/tag/scope-and-delimitations)scope and delimitations[](https://www.aje.com/arc/tag/limitations)limitations\nTable of contents\n[What are limitations in research?](#what-are-limitations-in-research?)[Why is identifying limitations important?](#why-is-identifying-limitations-important?)[How to write limitations](#how-to-write-limitations)[Don’t hide your limitations](#don’t-hide-your-limitations)[Writing limitations](#writing-limitations)[Examples of common limitations](#examples-of-common-limitations)[Methodology limitations](#methodology-limitations)[Research process limitations](#research-process-limitations)[Final thoughts](#final-thoughts)\nShare+\nFacebookTwitterLinkedInCopy linkEmail\nJoin the newsletter\nSign up for early access to AJE Scholar articles, discounts on AJE services, and more\nName\nEmail\nSign up now\nSee our \"Privacy Policy\"[](https://www.aje.com/security-and-privacy)\n## Ensure your structure and ideas are consistent and clearly communicated\nPair your Premium Editing with our add-on service [Presubmission Review](https://www.aje.com/services/presubmission-review) for an overall assessment of your manuscript.\n[\nOrder now\n](https://secure.aje.com/en/researcher/submit/get-started)\n![](https://images.prismic.io/aje-cms-production/Zpqz9x5LeNNTxUJ7_AJEPoweredbyMPS300x300-1-.png?auto=format,compress&w=256)\n[](https://twitter.com/journalexperts)[](https://www.facebook.com/AmericanJournalExperts)[](https://www.instagram.com/americanjournalexperts)[](https://www.linkedin.com/company/american-journal-experts)\nProfessional\n[English Editing](https://www.aje.com/services/editing)\n[VIP Editing](https://www.aje.com/services/vip-editing)\n[Scientific Editing](https://www.aje.com/services/scientific-editing)\n[Academic Translation](https://www.aje.com/services/translation)\n[Journal Recommendation](https://www.aje.com/services/journal-recommendation)\nSolutions\n[Abstract Editing](https://www.aje.com/services/abstracts)\n[Thesis Editing](https://www.aje.com/services/theses)\n[Manuscript Editing](https://www.aje.com/services/manuscripts)\n[Book Editing](https://www.aje.com/services/book-editing)\n[Research Quality Evaluation](https://www.aje.com/services/research-quality-evaluation/)\nFormatting services\n[Manuscript Formatting](https://www.aje.com/services/formatting)\n[Research Promotion](https://www.aje.com/services/research-promotion)\nFunding services\n[Grant Services](https://www.aje.com/services/grants)\nAutomated tools\n[Grammar Check](https://www.aje.com/grammar-check)\nRubriq\n[About & Pricing](https://www.aje.com/rubriq)\nResources\n[AJE Scholar Insights](https://www.aje.com/arc)\n[Author Resource Center](https://www.aje.com/resource-center)\n[Webinars](https://www.aje.com/webinars)\n[Pricing](https://www.aje.com/pricing)\n[Do Not Sell My Personal Information](https://www.aje.com/security-and-privacy/do-not-sell-my-personal-information)\n[Ethics](https://www.aje.com/about/ethics)\n[Quality](https://www.aje.com/quality-standards)\n[AJE Rewards](https://www.aje.com/aje-rewards)\nCompany\n[About AJE](https://www.aje.com/about)\n[Company](https://www.mpslimited.com/)\n[Contact](https://customer-support.aje.com/portal/en/newticket?departmentId=185360000000010772&layoutId=185360000000011350)\n---\n© 2025 American Journal Experts, LLC.
